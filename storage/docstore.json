Policies are intended to ensure that College direction, operations and practices are consistent with the College mission, values, strategic plans, legislative requirements, Minister's Binding Policy Directives and Board of Governors policies and priorities.\nPolicy\nPolicy Framework\nGovernance (i.e. Board) policies are established, overseen and administered by the Board of Governors. These policies provide strategic direction and guidance, and establish fundamental and key parameters for the institution.\u00a0 They include the delegation of authority and responsibilities to the President.\u00a0 The development, review and revision of Board policy are the responsibility of the Board of Governors and fall beyond the purview of this policy.\nAdministration (i.e. College) policies guide and direct the efficient and effective operation of the institution within the directions, parameters and limits established by Governance policy, College Mission, etc., and legislative requirements. Administrative policies reflect the responsibilities of the President, who is ultimately accountable for the policies and the implementation of them.\u00a0 The development, review and revision of College policy are governed by this policy.\nDepartmental policies are established and implemented by individual Schools or Departments to provide detailed direction regarding operations and matters specific to that area. These policies, and the development, review and revision of them, are the responsibility of the administrator of the operational area.\nDepartment policies must be consistent with, and are subordinate to, College policies which, in turn, must be consistent with, and are subordinate to, Board policies.\nCollege Policy Development\nThe development of a policy is the responsibility of the administrator most directly responsible for the ultimate implementation of and/or compliance with the policy. This responsible administrator is identified in this policy as the \u201cpolicy sponsor\u201d.\nThe policy sponsor will initiate, guide and oversee the creation, development and presentation for approval of the new policy.\nBefore initiating the creation of a new policy, the Policy Sponsor will request approval to do so\u00a0 from the responsible executive. The development of a new policy may not proceed without the approval of the responsible executive.\nDuring the development of a new policy, the policy sponsor will ensure that comment is sought, gathered and considered from College departments, individuals and groups who, it might reasonably be expected, will be impacted by the new policy.\nThe policy sponsor developing a policy that has the potential for legal challenges or entanglements or controversy should, with the approval of the responsible executive, seek review of the proposed policy by legal counsel.\nA proposed College policy must be considered by relevant (one or more) vice-president advisory committees (e.g. Deans Council, Student Services Committee, and Administrative Management Team) for comment.\nEvidence of consultations undertaken in the policy development process must accompany the proposed policy at each presentation of the policy.\nWhen a draft policy has been sufficiently developed, the policy sponsor, or designate, will present it to the relevant vice-president advisory committee(s) for consideration for recommendation to the College Leadership Team (CLT) for its consideration.\nA proposed College policy must be presented to the College Leadership Team (CLT) by the relevant vice-president, policy sponsor or designate, for its consideration for recommendation for approval to the President.\nA proposed College policy, recommended for approval by the CLT, will be considered by the President for approval.\nA proposed College policy will become an official College policy on approval by the President, effective on the date established by the President.\nThe official policy will be published on the College website, and notification of the policy will be broadcast to the College community.\nCollege Policy Review and Revision\nEach and every College policy must be formally reviewed within a period not to exceed five years from the date of first issue or the date of the last review. It should be noted that, while a policy review may lead to a revision(s), a revision of a policy does not,\nper se\n, constitute a review and may occur without a formal review of the policy.\nThe President's Office will be responsible for monitoring, directly or through delegation, the policy review schedule and informing the relevant executive of impending required policy reviews.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 5348, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8979135d-6dce-4c21-bdc7-5869813f49ec": {"__data__": {"id_": "8979135d-6dce-4c21-bdc7-5869813f49ec", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/nfs/nfs_dsw_phx2_prod/debajyotidasgupta6/chatbot/data/1000-1-1-policy-development-revision-and-publication.txt", "file_name": "1000-1-1-policy-development-revision-and-publication.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 13028, "creation_date": "2024-08-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-01"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "2b19a83b-f5a0-4d88-b217-09c04bc06eaf", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/nfs/nfs_dsw_phx2_prod/debajyotidasgupta6/chatbot/data/1000-1-1-policy-development-revision-and-publication.txt", "file_name": "1000-1-1-policy-development-revision-and-publication.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 13028, "creation_date": "2024-08-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-01"}, "hash": "d2356527be0c7fddf4dabfdcfb2bb5a820c4fa855f74d42cea56f5432b1a186f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "0696809a-0eb4-49be-9337-94287e0b6c7a", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/nfs/nfs_dsw_phx2_prod/debajyotidasgupta6/chatbot/data/1000-1-1-policy-development-revision-and-publication.txt", "file_name": "1000-1-1-policy-development-revision-and-publication.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 13028, "creation_date": "2024-08-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-01"}, "hash": "86e78dfd6e651c593432bbf82aebe193492e4f18e71367d41b247b640e784139", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "357eef24-974f-41a5-90e1-04942bf7e9e9", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "8ce54caf0065687ab0242d8c012f60d029d6bac9f47766bf3ce14927d879b982", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "A proposed College policy, recommended for approval by the CLT, will be considered by the President for approval.\nA proposed College policy will become an official College policy on approval by the President, effective on the date established by the President.\nThe official policy will be published on the College website, and notification of the policy will be broadcast to the College community.\nCollege Policy Review and Revision\nEach and every College policy must be formally reviewed within a period not to exceed five years from the date of first issue or the date of the last review.

The policy review described below is inclusive of all three possible outcomes.\nIt is the responsibility of the Executive Assistant, Senior Vice-President, Strategy & Corporate Services to ensure the currency of the policy by communicating that approaching need for a timely review of the policy. At a minimum, the timely review of a policy is dictated by the five-year period required above, and may be required sooner by changing circumstances, legislative requirements, board directions, etc.\nThe review of a policy will be undertaken and directed by the administrator most directly responsible for the implementation of and/or compliance with the policy (i.e. the policy sponsor).\nThe policy sponsor may initiate and will guide and oversee the review of the policy for which he is responsible.\nDuring the review of the policy, the policy sponsor will ensure that comment is sought, gathered and considered from College departments, individuals and groups who, it might reasonably be expected, will be impacted by any change in the policy.\nThe policy sponsor reviewing a policy that has the potential for legal challenges or entanglements or controversy should, with the approval of the responsible executive, seek review of the proposed policy by legal counsel.\nWhen the review of the policy is complete, the policy sponsor, or designate, will present the reviewed policy, with a recommendation for maintenance, revision, or deletion, to the relevant vice-president advisory committee for its consideration for recommendation to the CLT.\nA reviewed College policy must be presented to the CLT by the relevant vice-president, or designate, for its consideration for recommendation to the President.\nA reviewed College policy, recommended by the CLT, will be considered by the President for approval of continuation, revision or deletion, or not.\nA reviewed College policy will replace current College policy or policies or be deleted on approval by the President, effective on the date established by the President, and recorded on the published policy.\nThe reviewed policy will be published on, or deleted from, the College website, and notification of a revised or deleted policy will be broadcast to the College community.\nRevisions of Policy or Appendices\nOn occasion, a policy may be revised outside of the formal review process.\nIf the revision(s) is (are) of a significant nature, then the revised policy must be presented to the vice-president committee(s), the CLT and the President.\nIf the revision(s) is (are) of a minor nature, such that the significant values, expectations, directions, or procedures associated with or arising from the policy are unchanged, then the policy changes may be approved by the relevant vice-president and the revised policy published.\nThe revision of the policy should be reflected in the \"Last Revision\" date box at the top of the policy.\nThe revision of the policy should be added to the next agenda of the related vice-president committee for information purposes only.\nInformation within policy appendices may be revised, from time to time, by the responsible administrator (i.e. policy sponsor), at the administrator's discretion, without proceeding through the formal policy revision steps described above.\nThe College community must be provided with appropriate notification of such changes.\nArchiving of Policies\nA policy, or version of a policy, that is removed from publication, i.e. from the College website, because the policy has been deleted, revised or replaced by other policy, must be maintained in a policy archive, available for College community reference, for a minimum of ten years.\nPolicy Format\nA College policy must be published in the template and standard formatting established for College policies in order to ensure consistency, accessibility compliance, etc. The template is available by request to the Executive Assistant to the Senior Vice-President, Strategy & Corporate Services.\nPolicies must be written in plain English -

The retention schedules have been developed to govern how Lambton College meets legislation requirements, and student, client and partner expectations for the management of college documents and records.\nRecords may be paper- or electronic-based, and may be of an administrative or academic nature. All records should be retained for a period long enough to meet all legal requirements and foreseeable needs, but not so long that an unreasonable and unnecessary cost or burden is imposed on the College. The decision to retain records implies a commitment to maintain the records in a safe manner that is likely to preserve them for the required time.\nPolicy\nAll College records will be retained in a safe manner for the length of time prescribed in the Retention Schedule.\nRecords will be stored in a manner that prevents loss through misplacement, deterioration, accidental destruction, or theft, and unauthorized or inappropriate access. They shall be stored in a manner that ensures their continued readability and, in the case of electronic records, with the software and hardware necessary for readability. In some cases, the safe long-term storage of important records may require the duplication of the records and separate or off-site storage of the duplicates.\nThe retention and safe storage of records and documents as required by law, the Retention Schedule and good business practice is the responsibility of the dean or director identified below or, secondly, of the administrator of the department that generates the document or record.\nThe Director of Finance is responsible for the retention of all financial documents and records; the Director, Human Resources is responsible for the retention of all human resource records; and the Registrar is responsible for the retention of all student records and grades.\nThe director or dean is responsible for all other records and documents generated by departments or operations under his/her direction unless specifically stated otherwise.\nThe academic and student records and documents of the academic divisions and the Registrar\u2019s Office that do not fall within the scope of the Director of Finance or the Senior Vice-President, Strategy & Corporate Services shall be maintained by the Registrar, or dean or director of each school or division according to the Retention Schedule.\nThe Director of Finance and the Senior Vice-President, Strategy & Corporate Services may delegate the maintenance and retention of records to other department administrators and shall provide direction to the other departments on the retention of records that fall under their purview but are being held by the other department.\nThe administrator responsible for the retention of records is responsible for identifying those records that have met the required retention period, and directing and authorizing the destruction of them and for the conversion of records into another storage medium and the observance of all legal requirements pertaining to the conversion.\nTransitory records are records with only short term-value, and are used to complete a routine task or in the preparation of an ongoing record. Examples of transitory records include, but are not limited to, announcements and notices, drafts and duplicates, convenience copies, or routine correspondence. Transitory records may be destroyed securely at the discretion of the employee once the actions to which they relate, or their immediate purpose is completed unless directed otherwise by the director or dean.

Admission will be offered based on the ranking within each category and will proceed through the categories as listed.\nThe College reserves the right, as part of the College Indigenous Academic & Student Success Plan, to designate spaces in highly competitive programs to Indigenous (status, non-status, M\u00e9tis & Inuit) students who have satisfied the minimum program admission requirements.\nUnsuccessful Applicants\nConsistent with the Ministry guidelines, Lambton College provides applicants who feel that they have been inappropriately or unfairly denied admission a means to appeal the admission decision through written application to the Office of the Dean of the program. The required appeal form may be obtained from, and when completed, returned to the Office of the Registrar & Financial Aid Services for forwarding to the Office of the Dean. The decision will be appealed under the\nAppeal of an Academic Decision (2000-1-13) policy\n.\nThe program admission requirements and selection criteria may not be appealed.\nAppeal of admission decisions that are received less than five working days from before the first day of classes will only be considered for the next intake of the program.\nFor questions or concerns regarding this policy, please contact the\nPolicy Sponsor\nby phoning our main line 519-542-7751.\nSearch", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 16670, "end_char_idx": 21084, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "fe1c311e-144f-4a70-8a1b-c69d2095b7a5": {"__data__": {"id_": "fe1c311e-144f-4a70-8a1b-c69d2095b7a5", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/nfs/nfs_dsw_phx2_prod/debajyotidasgupta6/chatbot/data/2000-1-10-prior-learning-assessment-recognition---internal-external.txt", "file_name": "2000-1-10-prior-learning-assessment-recognition---internal-external.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 9833, "creation_date": "2024-08-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-01"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "d2e638ea-2dd7-413f-b7cb-eadb0ce74244", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/nfs/nfs_dsw_phx2_prod/debajyotidasgupta6/chatbot/data/2000-1-10-prior-learning-assessment-recognition---internal-external.txt", "file_name": "2000-1-10-prior-learning-assessment-recognition---internal-external.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 9833, "creation_date": "2024-08-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-01"}, "hash": "afc8a883060e0616e3e33721c627545c62f4ceee9c0458b434b8b2364dd137b0", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "382d9cde-b5de-4ede-80ea-84f36728716b", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "2f6cb1a62c51dc831c966acf0d40b463f4b1025b391c679557c6d4de4147f605", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "All Policies\n1000 Index, Circulation Lists, Amendments\n2000 Academic & Student Affairs\n3000 Personnel Administration\n4000 General Administration\n2000-1-10 Prior Learning Assessment & Recognition - Internal & External\nResponsible Executive\nSenior Vice-President, Academic & Student Success\nPolicy Sponsor\nDirectory, Institutional Intelligence & Registrar\nIssue Date\nOctober 31, 2016\nSupersedes Date\nMarch 28, 2017\nLast Review\nApril 7, 2021\nLast Revision\nApril 7, 2021\nUpon request, the college will provide a copy of this policy in an alternate format.\nLambton College recognizes the learning that takes place at other post-secondary institutions and endeavours to recognize that learning through the granting of credit. Lambton College also recognizes that learning may take place outside of formal post-secondary\n    institutions through life experience, non-formal study, work and training. Through the assessment of prior learning - both formal and informal - using processes that enable the student to demonstrate the prior learning, Lambton College can recognize\n    and grant credit towards a program or course.\nPolicy\nTransfer Credit (TC)\nA Transfer Credit (TC) may be awarded for a Lambton College course on the basis of a course that the student successfully completed at another post-secondary institution, which is determined to be substantially similar to the Lambton College course.\n            For the course to be deemed substantially similar, it must:\ncover or match 70% of the learning outcomes of the Lambton course,\ndemonstrate a rigour and depth comparable to the Lambton course, and\nemploy an evaluation scheme of reasonable soundness, with a variety of assessment methods and reasonable weighting attached to each evaluation.\nFor a TC to be considered, the student must have completed the course at the other institution with a grade of C or equivalent mark, within the previous seven years.\nAll currency considerations are dependent on the course and program in which the student is enrolled and will be determined by the program.\nA higher minimum grade may be required for a TC to be considered for specific Lambton College programs.\nTransfer student applicants, seeking credit for several courses as part of a program transfer, may be required to present a minimum grade point average for their program.\nThe TC application and the awarding of the TC grade must occur before the Registration Deadline. See\nRegistration (2000-1-2) policy\n.\nThe student applying for a TC must provide a transcript documenting the completion of the course, an outline for the previously completed course, and any other documents required by the assessor to make a thorough and accurate assessment of the course.\nThe number of courses and credits earned through transfer credits and/or Prior Learning Assessment & Recognition (PLAR) are limited by the College residency requirements including the requirement that a minimum of 25% of the courses and credits required\n            for graduation from a program must be earned at Lambton College or recognized as resident courses.

Where disagreements or concerns exist between parties, it is always desirable that a solution be found through informal discussion among the parties involved. However,\n    when this cannot be achieved, a formal resolution process is required.\nPolicy Scope\nThis policy is intended to provide a mechanism for complaint resolution in cases where a review of the professor's presentation of a course is sought.\nComplaints from individual students, including circumstances that fall under the\nRespectful College Community (4000-5-3) policy\nsuch as, but not limited to, harassment and discrimination - are outside of the scope of this policy.\nFurthermore, Lambton College recognizes that students may need assistance in identifying the appropriate complaint resolution mechanism and may need further support throughout the application processes. Students needing such support are encouraged to\ncontact their Student Success Navigator\n.\nPolicy\nStudents may request a formal review of the professor's presentation of a course through the Student Request for Review of Instruction process.\nA student-requested review may not be commenced after the 12th week of classes in a 15-week semester (four-fifths of a semester of any other length).\nStudents who seek a review of the delivery of a course must first attempt to resolve outstanding issues through discussions with their professor.\nIf the discussions with the professor do not address the concerns of the students, the students are encouraged to meet with the dean to resolve the issues through informal discussions among all parties.\nIf, after discussion with the professor, and the informal discussion with the dean - if undertaken - the issues remain unresolved, the students may request a review of instruction by obtaining a\nStudent Request for Review of Instruction form\nfrom the myLambton website. The form must be completed and delivered to the Office of the Registrar & Financial Aid Services.\nThe Student Request for Review of Instruction form must be completed by the student(s), and signed by at least one third of the students in the course section, and be accompanied by a detailed, written report describing the issues, students' concerns,\n            the discussions with the professor and the date(s) of the discussion(s). The completed form must be returned to the Registrar. The Student Request for Review of Instruction will not be considered complete without all of the required documentation.\nThe Registrar will verify the signatories with the class list. If the request is complete, the Registrar will forward the Student Request for Review of Instruction form to the professor's dean for action.\nUpon receipt of the form, including the documentation of the student-faculty discussions, the dean may choose to initially address the concerns through informal discussions with the students and, if necessary, the faculty. If a resolution satisfactory\n            to all parties (i.e. dean, students, faculty, is achieved) then the request will be considered closed.\nIf a satisfactory solution is not realized within three working days of the filing of the completed request with the Registrar, then the dean must enter into a formal review of the instruction of the course.\nIn undertaking the formal review, the dean must, within five working days of his/her receipt of the request, meet with the class or representative(s) to review the issues and concerns as well as the resolution sought. Subsequently, the dean must meet\n            with the professor to review and consider the details of the concerns and remedies sought by the students. For both meetings, the dean shall document the meetings (date, attendees, meeting notes).\nWithin three working days of the meeting with the professor, the dean will complete the formal review of instruction and meet with the professor to present his/her conclusions and any measures to be implemented.

The College has a responsibility to ensure that those decisions, and the manner in which they are determined, are transparent, objective, appropriate, fair and equitable.\nThe College is committed to all students having a reasonable opportunity to have decisions regarding their learning, performance and progress reviewed in a manner that respects the principles of fairness, equity and natural justice.\nPlease Note: Most academic decisions are made by teachers, who are supervised by a Dean (or Associate Dean). In some instances, however, an academic decision may be made by an individual who is not a teacher. In those cases, this policy may be read with\n    \"teacher\" replaced with \"decision-maker\" and \"Dean\" replaced with \"Supervisor\".\nPolicy\nAcademic Decision Appeal\nAny student registered at Lambton College may appeal a grade awarded in a course, or any decision or judgment made regarding the student's learning, competencies, standing in, progression through, or graduation from a program of study. See statement\n        11 below for examples.\nAppeals concerning disciplinary decisions, including academic dishonesty, are not governed by this policy, but rather the Student Rights, Responsibilities and Discipline policy. Concerns or issues arising from\n        harassment, discrimination, bullying and other such behaviours are not addressed through this policy but rather through College policies that address those matters directly, such as the Student Rights, Responsibilities and Discipline policy.\nThe appeal process consists of the Informal Appeal process and the Formal Appeal process. The Formal Appeal process will only be initiated once the Informal Appeal process has been undertaken in good faith and exhausted.\nInformal Appeal\nA student dissatisfied with an academic decision must initiate the appeal process by contacting the teacher. This contact must be made within ten College working days of the publication of the decision, e.g. issue of final grade by Registrar, or the\n        informing of the student of the decision.\nIn the student discussion with the teacher, the student must indicate the reason for dissatisfaction or disagreement with the decision and the remedy sought. Both parties should attempt to reach an understanding of the differences and, if possible\n        and appropriate, a resolution to the dissatisfaction.\nIf the student remains dissatisfied after the required discussion with the teacher and wishes to continue with the appeal, the student must contact the Dean of the teacher to arrange a meeting with the Dean.\nThe Dean, or designate, will meet with the student within three College working days to discuss the appeal.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4983, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b90cc645-a1d1-4aec-87b4-089e4029e3e7": {"__data__": {"id_": "b90cc645-a1d1-4aec-87b4-089e4029e3e7", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/nfs/nfs_dsw_phx2_prod/debajyotidasgupta6/chatbot/data/2000-1-13-appeal-of-an-academic-decision.txt", "file_name": "2000-1-13-appeal-of-an-academic-decision.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 17665, "creation_date": "2024-08-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-01"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "d2af8927-f46e-467e-a18e-0d0f83fb31c6", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/nfs/nfs_dsw_phx2_prod/debajyotidasgupta6/chatbot/data/2000-1-13-appeal-of-an-academic-decision.txt", "file_name": "2000-1-13-appeal-of-an-academic-decision.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 17665, "creation_date": "2024-08-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-01"}, "hash": "57cd559e1931d18753aaadafba9eb5eb10f10945a7f872e535d27d484d9b4e4b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "d4310592-34af-4bc4-815e-25af0b0b7b7c", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/nfs/nfs_dsw_phx2_prod/debajyotidasgupta6/chatbot/data/2000-1-13-appeal-of-an-academic-decision.txt", "file_name": "2000-1-13-appeal-of-an-academic-decision.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 17665, "creation_date": "2024-08-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-01"}, "hash": "15f237ba7952b6304f66383c00cf40da27d4a1d9d268763e185b0e95b8738d2b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "827e8fa3-3056-40a2-b699-3cb0fcc56793", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "3ef6a3f629d5f73a50340eebe784060f5fe6b0755b1269665895fe8735668a4d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "The Formal Appeal process will only be initiated once the Informal Appeal process has been undertaken in good faith and exhausted.\nInformal Appeal\nA student dissatisfied with an academic decision must initiate the appeal process by contacting the teacher.

An appeal will not be heard that, if successful, would result in a final grade change of one third of a grade or less, unless that change will affect the student's\n        progression in a program. e.g. a potential maximum grade change from B to B+ ( i.e. a third of a grade), with no other repercussions, is not a sufficient change to warrant a formal appeal.\nIn the appeal of an academic decision, the onus is on the student to demonstrate that the decision was inappropriate or faulty and should be modified or reversed.\nThe Associate Vice-President, Student Success will review the application for a Formal Academic Appeal to ensure that the prerequisites for an appeal have been met, and that the application clearly states what is being appealed, the reason for the\n        appeal and the remedy sought. The Associate Vice-President will permit the appeal to proceed when satisfied that all of the conditions have been met. A student dissatisfied with the decision of the Associate Vice-President, may appeal the decision\n        to the Senior Vice-President Academic.\nThe\u00a0Associate Vice-President, Student Success, on being satisfied that all requirements have been met, will form an Academic Appeal Panel to hear the appeal, and will schedule the hearing no fewer than two and no more than seven College working days\n        after receipt of the request for a Formal Appeal.\nA student who files a Formal Appeal request that is subsequently approved by the Associate Vice-President, Student Success will not be prevented from proceeding along the normal course of study, or in any other way disadvantaged (e.g. denied a refund\n        after the refund deadline) or held back, while the formal appeal proceeds. Ultimately, if the appeal is lost, the student's status or situation must reflect the outcome of the appeal.

Scholarship is supported and encouraged through the provision and guarantee of academic freedom\n    for teachers, researchers and students.\nAcademic freedom includes the freedom, without restriction by prescribed doctrine or threat of institutional censorship, to teach and discuss; carry out research and disseminate and publish the results thereof; express one's opinion; acquire, preserve,\n    and provide access to documentary material in all formats; participate in professional and representative academic bodies.\n[1]\nIn short, \"it is the right to teach, learn,\n    study and publish free of orthodoxy or threat of reprisal and discrimination.\"\n[2]\nAcademic freedom must be based on reasoned discourse, rigorous extensive research and scholarship, and peer review. Evidence and truth must be the guiding principles. Academic freedom is constrained by the professional standards of the relevant discipline\n    and the responsibility of the institution to organize its academic mission.\n[3]\nThe constraint of institutional requirements recognizes that the academic mission, like other work, has to be organized according to institutional needs. This includes the institution's responsibility to select and appoint faculty and staff, to admit\n    and discipline students, to establish and control curriculum, to make organizational arrangements for the conduct of academic work, to certify completion of a program and to grant degrees.\n[4]\nFaculty must be committed to the highest ethical standards in their teaching and research. They must be free to examine data, question assumptions and be guided by evidence. Faculty have an equal responsibility to submit their knowledge and claims to\n    rigorous and public review by peers who are experts in the subject matter under consideration and to ground their arguments in the best available evidence.\n[5]\nPolicy\nScholarship is integral and essential to Lambton College. Faculty members and researchers are encouraged to engage in the full spectrum of scholarship activities. Within its means, Lambton College will seek to provide the opportunities, infrastructure\n            and academic freedom necessary to support and encourage a high level of scholarship.\nAcademic freedom is the right of a faculty member, researcher or student to engage openly and freely in scholarship activities free of orthodoxy and the fear or threat of reprisal, including impairment of position. Academic freedom does not require\n            neutrality on the part of the individual. The reason for academic freedom is to make reasoned, rigorous and ethical scholarship - with its discourse and critique - possible without repression or fear of reprisal by other individuals, the institution\n            or government.\nAcademic freedom for the individual within the College implies protection of the individual by the College from pressures intended to censor or restrict the individual from pursuing scholarly and research interests and communicating the results to\n            students, colleagues and the community-at-large. Individuals within Lambton College are entitled to freedom in scholarly activities, including research and inquiry and the dissemination of the results, within the constraints or limitations identified\n            by this policy.\nAcademic freedom is not an unrestricted absolute. It is predicated on reasoned, rigorous and ethical scholarship that is guided by evidence and truth, and constrained by the institution's requirements to fulfill its mandate and mission, and by its\n            responsibilities to students and community. Those requirements and responsibilities include compliance with federal and provincial government legislation and directives, and the determination and fulfillment of program learning outcomes.\nThe freedom to publish or otherwise disseminate research findings may also be constrained or limited by research contracts to which the college faculty and researchers or College are parties.\nResearch and scholarship are to be conducted ethically and in ways that fully respect human rights as defined in law and the dignity of individuals, and are appropriate to and consistent with the researcher's or scholar's College appointment.\nCollege faculty and researchers are members of an educational institution whose special position in the community brings with it unique expectations and obligations.\nEmployees and students must therefore be cognizant of their position\n            - real or implied or inferred - as institutional representatives. When such persons exercise their entitlement under academic freedom or their rights as citizens, they should be free from institutional censorship or discipline.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 5341, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "cff038b2-4955-49f1-8448-e2dd68be9d14": {"__data__": {"id_": "cff038b2-4955-49f1-8448-e2dd68be9d14", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/nfs/nfs_dsw_phx2_prod/debajyotidasgupta6/chatbot/data/2000-1-14-academic-freedom---rights-responsibilities.txt", "file_name": "2000-1-14-academic-freedom---rights-responsibilities.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 6854, "creation_date": "2024-08-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-01"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "994c9ce0-3ec1-4551-b084-8dae02e77e45", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/nfs/nfs_dsw_phx2_prod/debajyotidasgupta6/chatbot/data/2000-1-14-academic-freedom---rights-responsibilities.txt", "file_name": "2000-1-14-academic-freedom---rights-responsibilities.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 6854, "creation_date": "2024-08-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-01"}, "hash": "1c3527e3dcaf9a01192f1a902b5aa10b0eceef41f1c28c2834f92b4e26f0dae0", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "8f14c0a9-5681-4864-b4bd-01f687bf066b", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/nfs/nfs_dsw_phx2_prod/debajyotidasgupta6/chatbot/data/2000-1-14-academic-freedom---rights-responsibilities.txt", "file_name": "2000-1-14-academic-freedom---rights-responsibilities.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 6854, "creation_date": "2024-08-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-01"}, "hash": "be23e1eb355897035217e76ca2c1352702131a9872feca7ce727f9ea6e9ccb1f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Those requirements and responsibilities include compliance with federal and provincial government legislation and directives, and the determination and fulfillment of program learning outcomes.\nThe freedom to publish or otherwise disseminate research findings may also be constrained or limited by research contracts to which the college faculty and researchers or College are parties.\nResearch and scholarship are to be conducted ethically and in ways that fully respect human rights as defined in law and the dignity of individuals, and are appropriate to and consistent with the researcher's or scholar's College appointment.\nCollege faculty and researchers are members of an educational institution whose special position in the community brings with it unique expectations and obligations.\nEmployees and students must therefore be cognizant of their position\n            - real or implied or inferred - as institutional representatives.

Hence, faculty, researchers and students must be accurate and truthful, and exercise\n            appropriate respect for others and their opinions. They shall also clearly indicate whether they are expressing personal or institutional opinions or positions.\nAcademic freedom does not confer legal immunity from either criminal prosecution or civil action, whether from a claim for damages by a third-party or the seeking of indemnification and recovery by the College.

The College also recognizes\n    that the learning needs of individual students may vary from person to person and with time and circumstances, and so may, in some cases, deserve special consideration and accommodation.\nPolicy\nNo recording - mechanical, electronic, audio, video, still photography - is permitted in the classroom, laboratory or other learning or teaching-learning setting or environment without the express, written permission of the teacher or other College\n        employee responsible for the setting or environment.\nA student who wishes to record in the classroom, laboratory or other learning or teaching-learning setting or environment must request and receive permission - expressly given in writing - from the teacher, or other responsible College employee in\n        authority, before any recording begins. The request must specify the date, time, location and other parameters defining the limits of the recording for which permission is sought. Permission to record is solely at the discretion of the teacher.\nIn the case of a student with a documented disability seeking to record as an accommodation or support for his/her learning, a signed recommendation from The Accessibility Centre recommending such accommodation shall cause the permission not to be\n        unreasonably withheld.\nWhere the recording will capture the image or voice of other students or guests - other than incidentally - the permission, in writing, of the affected students or guests must also be obtained, and shown to the teacher or other responsible College\n        employee when recording permission is sought.\nWhere permission for recording is denied by the teacher or other responsible College employee, the student may appeal the decision to the (Associate) Dean responsible for the course or activity for which recording permission is sought. Further appeal\n        of any decision is available through\nAppeal of an Academic Decision (2000-1-13) policy\n.\nWhere permission is granted for any recording, the recording may be used only by the student to whom permission was given for the recording and only for his/her personal learning purposes. The recording, in whole or in part, may not be shared, copied,\n        distributed or posted, in any way. The content of the recording remains the property of Lambton College and/or the teacher.\nWhere permission is granted for recording, the student must agree in writing to the conditions, limitations or provisions set down with the permission. Failure to do so will result in the loss of the permission to record, and may result in disciplinary\n        actions by the College.\nA student given permission to record must respect the privacy, dignity and comfort of others when recording or using the recordings. The recording cannot be distracting or disruptive for others.\nPersons using recording devices anywhere on campus for any purpose must respect the privacy, dignity, comfort and rights of others when making or sharing recordings.

For breadth requirements associated with Certificate, Diploma, and Advanced Diplomas, please see the\nGeneral Education (2000-1-8) policy\n.\nAn Ontario College degree is a degree program in an applied area of study that incorporates a prescribed set of courses/studies and work-integrated learning oriented to a field of practice. Ontario College degrees culminate in mastery of the bodies of\n    knowledge and skills appropriate to the Honours Baccalaureate Degree Standard of the Ontario Qualifications Framework (OQF) in the field of study, and mastery of the knowledge and skills necessary to be an effective practitioner upon graduation, and\n    to remain professionally current thereafter.\nThe curriculum of an Ontario College degree program in an applied area of study is shaped by these characteristics:\na technical or professional education based on the fundamental principles in each field;\napplication of theory to practice, of learning by doing, and of converting personal experience into knowledge and skills through laboratory, applied research, and work experience;\ncultivation of the analytical skills to evaluate new information and the ability to apply new knowledge to the field; and\na balance of professional study and general education/breadth courses to enhance students' understanding of the environment in which they will function as professionals and as educated citizens and to enhance their understanding by exposure to disciplines\n        outside their main field of study.\n1\nPolicy\nCollege and Program Requirements\nAll degree programs at Lambton College will meet the requirements of and be consistent with the letter and the spirit of the Post-Secondary Education Quality Assessment Board (PEQAB) Standards and Ministerial requirements as they pertain to curriculum\n            breadth in degree programs.\nThe curriculum of degree programs typically will include 20% non-core courses, that is, of all the courses required in a program of study, 80% will be core (professional) courses and 20% will be non-core (breadth) courses.\nUndergraduate programs associated with accrediting bodies or other industry/professional regulatory bodies may depart from this norm, especially if meeting the 20% non-core benchmark would drive the total program to an extraordinary number\n                    of credit hours\nIt is desirable that the majority of a program\u2019s non-core courses be elective courses. Where this is not possible, at least one non-core course must be an elective, freely chosen by the student. A student will be able to meet the program\u2019s non-core\n            requirements by choosing individual non-core courses from a collection of non-core courses that have been approved by the College.\nIn those cases in which a specific non-core course is mandated by a program, the course must be a non-core course approved by the College and not on the Restricted List for the program.\nThe College and program must ensure that the non-core courses offered and available as electives are sufficient and appropriate to enable the student to meet the non-core course requirements of the program.\nThe College and the program will recognize and accept for the fulfillment of program non-core requirements, courses that are:\ndegree-level and non-core courses as determined by program faculty and the College Curriculum Committee and approved by the College, and\ndelivered by Lambton College, or\ndelivered by Ontario Learn, or\ndelivered by a recognized post-secondary institution and approved by the College Curriculum Committee as a degree-level, non-core course.\nStudent Requirements\nIn order to graduate from a degree program, the student must fully and successfully meet the published non-core requirements of the program.\nA student must successfully complete, counting mandated and elective non-core courses:\na course from at least two of the non-core categories;\nat least one lower-level non-core course and at least two upper-level non-core courses. In exceptional situations, in which the degree program curriculum is required to meet the requirements of accrediting bodies or other industry/professional\n                    regulatory bodies, students may be permitted to complete a minimum of one upper-level non-core course.\nA student may not use a non-core course that is listed on the non-core Restricted Courses list for the program to meet program requirements.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 5062, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d30ff08c-d51d-4b30-b03f-c5604675cfc4": {"__data__": {"id_": "d30ff08c-d51d-4b30-b03f-c5604675cfc4", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/nfs/nfs_dsw_phx2_prod/debajyotidasgupta6/chatbot/data/2000-1-16-degree-program-non-core-courses.txt", "file_name": "2000-1-16-degree-program-non-core-courses.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 8271, "creation_date": "2024-08-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-01"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "58196ddb-85f7-41a0-a6b1-7b18224126ec", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/nfs/nfs_dsw_phx2_prod/debajyotidasgupta6/chatbot/data/2000-1-16-degree-program-non-core-courses.txt", "file_name": "2000-1-16-degree-program-non-core-courses.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 8271, "creation_date": "2024-08-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-01"}, "hash": "e47014a05bd2d9e8686ffacde673e1c56608e3db319f607bd7276e1469487129", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "2feaf224-dfe3-48ce-ba2c-4baeb9abbd39", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/nfs/nfs_dsw_phx2_prod/debajyotidasgupta6/chatbot/data/2000-1-16-degree-program-non-core-courses.txt", "file_name": "2000-1-16-degree-program-non-core-courses.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 8271, "creation_date": "2024-08-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-01"}, "hash": "452fe2fa0ac5eadae6ac355ca06355a5adf2b79468f9d234bdb7f0d360ce8ac9", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Student Requirements\nIn order to graduate from a degree program, the student must fully and successfully meet the published non-core requirements of the program.\nA student must successfully complete, counting mandated and elective non-core courses:\na course from at least two of the non-core categories;\nat least one lower-level non-core course and at least two upper-level non-core courses.

The\n    faculty and College have a responsibility to ensure that students are evaluated and graded within a structure and in a manner that is known to the student, transparent, objective, appropriate, fair and equitable. (\nAppeal of an Academic Decision (2000-1-13) policy\n)\nStudents have a responsibility to respect the faculty's right to establish standards for classroom behaviour and decorum; determine the learning and evaluation activities, methods and processes; and, generally, conduct the course in the manner that the\n    professor determines to be appropriate. (\nStudent Rights & Responsibilities & Discipline (2000-5-1) policy\n)\nStudents have a right to be objectively and impartially graded and to appeal any evaluation or decision that affects their grades. (\nAppeal of an Academic Decision (2000-1-13) policy\n)\nPolicy\nThe learning and progress of the students in each course are evaluated by the course faculty member.\nThe College, in conjunction with the faculty member, will:\nestablish the means and methods by which the student's learning will be evaluated,\ncommunicate to the students - usually through the course outline - how they will be evaluated,\nconduct evaluations in a manner consistent with the information provided to the students,\ngrade or assess the work and learning of the students in a fair, objective and transparent manner,\ninform the students, in a timely fashion (10 working days), of the results of the evaluations,\ninform the students of their progress through the course with a current record of evaluation results and, if feasible and reasonable, a statement or measure of their standing in the course (e.g. current average.)\nAll communications to a student(s) concerning evaluation results and course standing shall be conducted by means that ensure the confidentiality of the information (e.g. secure learning management system, not an office-door posting), and in a manner\n            that respects the student and the student's efforts.\nStudents normally will be evaluated through a variety of methods, such as tests, assignments, participation, clinical observation, etc., as determined by the faculty and described in the course outline. The course outline will describe the evaluation\n            components, structure and weights.\nNo single evaluation may have a weight of more than 40% in the calculation of the final grade.\nNotwithstanding the above statement, in those cases in which the majority of the course is delivered at a distance or online, up to 50% of the final grade may be determined in a single proctored evaluation.\nIn exceptional circumstances, such as a capstone project or a field or clinical placement, where it may be necessary to exceed the maximum, the relevant Dean may grant permission for the maximum to be exceeded.\nIn a course offered to degree programs, a minimum of 30% of the final grade shall be determined through evaluations that are proctored or supervised by College faculty. Any exception to this requirement must be approved by the appropriate Dean responsible\n            for the course's delivery.\nThe College may establish one or more course requirements - deemed to be essential to the delivery of the course or the realization of the course outcomes - that must be met in order to complete successfully the course. Such requirements must be consistent\n            with course learning outcomes and not be unreasonably applied. The teacher may assign a failing grade where a student has achieved a passing final average mark or grade but has not successfully fulfilled all requirements for passing the course\n            as stipulated in the course outline.\nStudents may not be evaluated or graded on the basis of attendance (i.e. marks cannot be awarded or withheld on the basis of attendance). Students may be evaluated (i.e. marks awarded), for participation, skills demonstration, etc. Such evaluations\n            must be undertaken in a demonstrably objective manner (e.g. use of an evaluation rubric.)

In some instances, with prior permission, a student may complete a co-requisite course before the related course.\nThe student is responsible for ensuring that all prerequisite and co-requisite conditions are met before registering in a course. Failure to meet a pre- or co-requisite will result in the de-registration of the student from the related course.\nFailure to meet a prerequisite, or co-requisite will result in the de-registration for the student from the related course.\nFor degree programs, the completions of a course without the successful completion of any prerequisite, or co-requisite courses will not be recognized and will not receive credit or a grade.\nFor degree programs, if the prerequisite to a previously failed course changes prior to the student repeating the course, the new prerequisite is binding on the student.\nFor degree programs, a failed prerequisite or co-requisite will not be upgraded to a passing grade on the basis of successful completion of the related course.\nFor degree programs, it is at the discretion of the Dean to override prerequisite or co-requisite requirements.\nProgram Progression\nIn order to advance in good academic standing to a subsequent semester of a program, a full-time student must maintain both a term and program Grade Point Average (GPA) of 2.00.\nA full-time student whose term GPA is less than 2.00 is considered to be in Academic Jeopardy. A student in this state may continue in his program. After grades have been issued at the end of each term, the Registrar will issue to each student in\n        Academic Jeopardy a warning concerning his poor performance and the consequences of future poor performance.\nA full-time student who achieves a term GPA of less than 1.50 in three terms, in one or multiple programs, over any three calendar years (nine consecutive semesters) will be dismissed from the College by the Registrar for 12 months. A student seeking\n        re-admission to a College program after dismissal must re-apply for admission to the College. See the Application & Admission to Programs (2000-1-1) policy - sections 38-41 (Academic Dismissal).\nPrograms may have program-specific progression rules. Program progression rules identify requirements (e.g. a course grade of C or greater, successful completion of all courses in an AAL) that must be met in order for the student to progress to a\n        higher Academic Achievement Level (AAL), or register in higher level courses, or graduate from the program.\nProgram progression and graduation requirements will be published in course outlines when the requirements relate to specific courses and in program documents.\nIt is the student's responsibility to be aware of and meet all program progression rules in a timely fashion.\nThe student's standing (Good Standing, Jeopardy, Dismissal) at the end of each semester will be noted on the student's transcript.\nRepeated Courses\nA student may attempt a course: low up to three times. After the second attempt, the student must receive permission from the student's program Dean for the third attempt. Conditions, requirements, a learning contract, etc. may be established for\n        the third attempt.\nSome programs may not allow progression or graduation with more than one failure of an individual required course.\nProgram restrictions on the repetition of courses will be published in program documents.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4721, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2177bef4-865a-4072-8ac8-f1f7bb6c81ff": {"__data__": {"id_": "2177bef4-865a-4072-8ac8-f1f7bb6c81ff", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/nfs/nfs_dsw_phx2_prod/debajyotidasgupta6/chatbot/data/2000-1-5-progression-graduation-from-a-program.txt", "file_name": "2000-1-5-progression-graduation-from-a-program.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 14827, "creation_date": "2024-08-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-01"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "127fe0ff-01af-47de-9e09-92e4367313cc", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/nfs/nfs_dsw_phx2_prod/debajyotidasgupta6/chatbot/data/2000-1-5-progression-graduation-from-a-program.txt", "file_name": "2000-1-5-progression-graduation-from-a-program.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 14827, "creation_date": "2024-08-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-01"}, "hash": "e7943c2173e5dbf0c42aa32ae7628669e1d331a5cc4788dce167557118631b4d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "d6142542-f31a-437a-b03e-e72cba5b4887", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/nfs/nfs_dsw_phx2_prod/debajyotidasgupta6/chatbot/data/2000-1-5-progression-graduation-from-a-program.txt", "file_name": "2000-1-5-progression-graduation-from-a-program.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 14827, "creation_date": "2024-08-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-01"}, "hash": "f8ab249d695ca1f7daa26ec3161fd3d70ad15837285eda159d9c3035df1da8d3", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "95ee026a-5f03-43be-bed4-2b62218c3b90", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "c7a37bc73f92453f658c2e4842872eedb9dc9321d501a48fbf5c18ac39cb6fe1", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Program progression and graduation requirements will be published in course outlines when the requirements relate to specific courses and in program documents.\nIt is the student's responsibility to be aware of and meet all program progression rules in a timely fashion.\nThe student's standing (Good Standing, Jeopardy, Dismissal) at the end of each semester will be noted on the student's transcript.\nRepeated Courses\nA student may attempt a course: low up to three times.

The requirement to repeat a level may include the requirement to repeat courses previously passed. In such cases, to progress, the student must pass all courses, including repeated courses.\nGraduation from a Program\nTo be eligible for graduation from a program, a student must satisfy all of the following conditions.\nMinimum Grade Point Average\nIn order to graduate from a program, the student must achieve the following minimum final Grade Point Average(s).\nThe student must achieve a final program Grade Point Average of 2.00 or greater.\nIn a degree program, the student must achieve a final cumulative Grade Point Average of 2.00 or greater for all core courses and for all non-core courses.\nSome programs may require a greater final Grade Point Average(s). These greater requirements will be published by the program.\nRequired Courses\nThe student must successfully complete all required courses in order to graduate from a program.\nThe student must achieve the minimum passing grade and progression grade in in each and every course prescribed for the program from which graduation is expected.\nIn programs other than degree programs, D is the College minimum passing grade and progression grade.\nIn degree programs, D is the minimum passing grade and C- is the minimum progression/graduation grade.\nSome programs may require for progression through and/or graduation from the program, a grade or grades greater than the College minimum grade. In such cases, the program-required minimum grades must be achieved.\nProgram-specific minimum grades for progression and graduation will be published in the relevant course outlines and in program documents.\nThe student may also successfully complete a course through transfer credit, Prior Learning Assessment and Recognition (PLAR), course substitution or exemption.\nCurrency of Courses\nCourses must be current in order to be counted towards program graduation requirements. Courses completed more than seven years prior to graduation will normally be considered stale-dated (i.e. not current) and therefore not acceptable for meeting\n        program graduation requirements.\nExceptions to the above currency requirement may be granted by the program Dean when the lack of currency of the course(s) does not jeopardize the student's achievement of the program learning outcomes/goals or the student's preparation for\n                further studies or professional undertakings.\nCurrent Program Requirements\nThe student must successfully complete the course requirements of the program version in effect at the time of graduation (i.e. the program version of the currently graduating students who are completing the program in the normal, scheduled time frame)\n        unless the program Dean has approved alternative arrangements in writing to the Registrar.\nThe requirements for graduation from the program will include any changes made to the curriculum while the student is in progress in the program, provided that the changes are published six months prior to implementation (failing published notice\n        of six months, a two-thirds majority of affected students may permit the change) and the changes are implemented prior to or at the time at which a student, following the normal, on-time progression through the program curriculum, would normally\n        be scheduled for that part of the curriculum. The program graduation requirements will not include changes made to the curriculum in semesters that had already been completed by a student following the normal, on-time progression through the program.\n        A student who has worked ahead of the normal, on-time progression through the curriculum will not be disadvantaged or faced with additional requirements because of the curriculum changes.\nInterrupted Studies\nA student who does not register in a program for two or more successive academic terms normally scheduled for the program will be considered as having interrupted studies.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 3825, "end_char_idx": 9106, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "95ee026a-5f03-43be-bed4-2b62218c3b90": {"__data__": {"id_": "95ee026a-5f03-43be-bed4-2b62218c3b90", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/nfs/nfs_dsw_phx2_prod/debajyotidasgupta6/chatbot/data/2000-1-5-progression-graduation-from-a-program.txt", "file_name": "2000-1-5-progression-graduation-from-a-program.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 14827, "creation_date": "2024-08-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-01"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "127fe0ff-01af-47de-9e09-92e4367313cc", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/nfs/nfs_dsw_phx2_prod/debajyotidasgupta6/chatbot/data/2000-1-5-progression-graduation-from-a-program.txt", "file_name": "2000-1-5-progression-graduation-from-a-program.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 14827, "creation_date": "2024-08-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-01"}, "hash": "e7943c2173e5dbf0c42aa32ae7628669e1d331a5cc4788dce167557118631b4d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "2177bef4-865a-4072-8ac8-f1f7bb6c81ff", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/nfs/nfs_dsw_phx2_prod/debajyotidasgupta6/chatbot/data/2000-1-5-progression-graduation-from-a-program.txt", "file_name": "2000-1-5-progression-graduation-from-a-program.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 14827, "creation_date": "2024-08-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-01"}, "hash": "ef344384a3c672f44a132292aa6692f9512a41a23d20557669b8545150eb33a9", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "f8083b90-e98f-4113-9dd0-c01e6dc3c07d", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "f2d8b317035dbb3b0c269674d125993e89a0cf1692f35b29c4f049c88228b9b2", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "The requirements for graduation from the program will include any changes made to the curriculum while the student is in progress in the program, provided that the changes are published six months prior to implementation (failing published notice\n        of six months, a two-thirds majority of affected students may permit the change) and the changes are implemented prior to or at the time at which a student, following the normal, on-time progression through the program curriculum, would normally\n        be scheduled for that part of the curriculum.

That is, the returning student will be required to fulfill the requirements of the\n        program version in place for the students in the program term to which the student is returning who are following the normal, on-time progression through the program.\nOn resumption of studies after an interruption, the student's previously completed courses will be assessed by the program department against the current version of the program curriculum. (See the above statement.) The Dean will establish the requirements\n        to be met in order for the student to graduate from the program version in effect on the student's return to the program.\nAfter a break in any duration in the normal course of studies, a student may be required to demonstrate skills or knowledge that are sufficient to permit a return to studies or clinical placement that is safe and with a reasonable chance of success.\nStudents who have interrupted their studies may not be eligible to graduate from a program that is no longer offered (suspended or cancelled) by the College. See the\nGraduation from a Suspended or Cancelled Program\nsection in this policy.\nProgram Completion Time Limit\nThe student is expected to complete the program within 150% of the normal full-time program duration, beginning with the date of the student's initial enrolment in the program. Students with documented disabilities may be expected to take up to 200%\n        of the normal full-time program duration. For degree programs, the corresponding maximum durations are 175% and 200%.\nThe student who has not completed the program within the above time frame will become subject to the program curriculum and requirements in place at the time of graduation (i.e. the requirements faced by the currently graduating students who are completing\n        the program following the normal, on-time progression through the program). The Dean will establish the requirements to be met in order for the student to meet the graduation requirements of the program version in effect at the time of graduation.\nStudents who have extended their studies beyond the normal program completion time may not be eligible to graduate from a program that is no longer offered (suspended or cancelled) by the College. The policy statements below concerning graduation\n        from a suspended or cancelled program may supersede the above statements concerning program completion time limits.\u00a0See the\nGraduation from a Suspended or Cancelled Program\nsection within this\n        policy.\nResidency Requirement\nThe student must have successfully completed at Lambton College at least 25% of the courses and credit-hours in the program in order to satisfy residency requirements. See the\nResidency Requirements & Recording of Courses & Grades (2000-1-9)\u00a0policy\n.\nAdditional Program Requirements\nWhere a program establishes additional requirements beyond the successful completion of required courses, these additional requirements must be satisfactorily completed (e.g. time requirements, fitness requirements.).\nGraduation Application\nA prospective graduate must submit an application for graduation to the Office of the Registrar & Financial Aid Services at least ten weeks before the date of the convocation ceremony.\nPrograms whose end dates extend beyond the regular end dates of the academic year of programs with a final term scheduled to take place over the Spring (May/June) are deemed as having provisional status. Students registered in these programs will\n        be allowed to participate in the annual spring convocation ceremonies as provisional graduates.

Any actions\n    taken by the student that subvert, or potentially subvert, the validity of the evaluation are considered actions of academic dishonesty.\nPolicy\nWhen students write evaluations, whether paper-based or electronic, they must take all reasonable precautions to ensure that they have eliminated all possible means or opportunities to cheat. It is the students'\n            responsibility to ensure their desk, lab bench, computer desk, etc., and clothing, body, etc., are free of anything that could be used to cheat.\nDuring the evaluation, the student may not have with them or nearby:\nany electronic devices (e.g. cell phone, audio player, calculator, smart watch, etc.), with the exception of assistive devices, recognized by the Accessibility Centre;\nany pencil case, purse, backpack, or other carrying device;\nany paper, notes, books, etc.;\nany drink containers, or any food or drink, except for water bottles without labels\nany hats, coats, jackets or other extraneous clothing items;\nany writing, symbols, formulae, etc., on the desk, lab bench, any adjacent surfaces, clothing or body; unless explicitly permitted by the evaluation invigilator(s).\nAny items within the student's area beyond worn clothing, writing instruments and photo identification must be explicitly and specifically identified and approved by the invigilator or supplied by the invigilator.\nThere must be no communication with any person, other than the invigilator, during the evaluation.\nStudents must display Lambton College photo identification on their desk or bench.\nThe invigilator will identify the times during the evaluation when students may enter the evaluation room to begin the evaluation and leave the evaluation room at the completion of the evaluation.\nIn no case may a student enter the room to begin an evaluation after a student has left the room.\nAt the end of the evaluation time, as determined by the invigilator, the student must immediately cease work on the evaluation instrument (e.g. test paper, exam) and immediately submit it to the invigilator, per the invigilator's instructions. Failure\n            to cease work and/or submit the instrument as instructed may result in the instrument not being accepted, or a mark penalty being levied or the filing of an academic dishonesty allegation, any one of which may result in sanctions including a mark of zero on the evaluation.\nStudents undertaking an evaluation in a location different than the other students (e.g. The Testing Centre) will normally write the evaluation at the same time as the other students and be subject to the commencement and completion rules described\n            immediately above.\nFailure to comply with the above procedures will be considered, an act of academic dishonesty and a breach of the Student Code of Conduct.\nThe College recognizes that education is a service under the Human Rights Code and commits to providing a learning environment that promotes accessibility for people with disabilities. This extends to providing reasonable academic accommodation to students with disabilities.

[Minister's Binding Policy Directive\nFramework for Programs of Instruction\n]\nGeneral Education strengthens students' generic skills, such as critical analysis, problem solving, and communication, in the context of an exploration of topics with broad-based personal and / or societal importance. [Minister's Binding Policy Directive\nFramework for Programs of Instruction\n]\nPolicy\nProgram Requirements\nAll post-secondary programs at Lambton College will meet the requirements of and be consistent with the letter and the spirit of the Minister's Binding Policy Directive\nFramework for Programs of Instruction\nas it pertains to general education\n            in post-secondary programs.\nCertificate, diploma, and advanced diploma programs typically will include the following:\nDiploma - Three General Education Courses\nAdvanced Diploma - Three General Education Courses\nStudents shall be exposed to at least one discipline outside their main field of study.\nGeneral Education courses must be offered as elective courses allowing a student to choose a specific course from a variety of general education courses approved by the College that meet the student's program general education requirement.\nIn those exceptional cases in which a general education course is mandated for a program, the course must be drawn from the list of courses approved as general education courses by the College.\nStudent Requirements\nA general education course chosen by a student may not be listed on the Restricted Courses list for his/her program.\nGeneral Education Courses - Definition & Approval\nA course is recognized as a General Education course only if it is recommended by the Dean responsible for General Education, and approved by the Director, Institutional Intelligence & College Registrar as a general education course and subsequently placed on the General\n            Education Approved Course List.\nA General Education course shall have learning outcomes that meet the requirements of one of the general education themes as set down in the Minister's Binding Directive\nFramework for Programs of Instruction.\nConsistent with and in addition to the requirements of the\nFramework for Programs of Instruction\n, to be designated a General Education course, a course shall meet the following criteria:\nenable learners to effectively meet the societal challenges that face them as they take their place in community, family and working life;\ndevelop attitudes and skills that are conducive to critical thinking, self-expression and communication with others;\nbe non-vocational (i.e. not profession-specific), contributing to learning that is distinct from specific program vocational skills/outcomes;\nnot requires students to develop and demonstrate proficiency in specific applied skills;\nnot overlap with core program courses (e.g. if a program requires core psychological concepts, students cannot use an introductory psychology course to satisfy program general education course requirements);\nbe a discrete course designed to meet one of the five themes outlined in the MTCU guidelines;\nincorporate an academic rigour equivalent to other comparable Lambton College courses, including workload, course outcomes and evaluations that are consistent with the college expectations for a three credit-hour course;\nrequire neither a prerequisite course nor specialized knowledge beyond the basic aptitudes of a college student.\nCourses identified as General Education may be restricted from use in meeting the general education requirements of some programs because of insufficient difference from core program material.\nA list of the courses that qualify as General Education courses shall be published by the Office of the Registrar & Financial Aid Services and the programs in which the courses may not be used to meet program general education requirements will be\n            identified as restricted.\nRecognition of Transferred Courses as General Education Courses\nGeneral Education courses taken at Lambton College in one program may be recognized as General Education courses in a second program provided that the course(s) is consistent with the program requirements, stipulations or restrictions

another institution must meet the requirements set out in the\nPrior Learning Assessment & Recognition - Internal & External (2000-1-10) policy\n.\nIn particular, the course completed at the other institution must be \"determined to be substantially similar to the Lambton College course\" and\n...\"in order for a TC to be considered, the student must have completed the course at the other institution with a grade of C or a mark of 63% or better, ...\"\nFor further clarity, an external course being transferred into a Lambton College program as a general education course is not subject to a currency requirement, i.e. is not required to have been completed with the previous seven years.\nRecognition of the course from another institution for a Transfer Credit for a Lambton course that is designated as a general education course in a particular program will also cause the transferred course to be recognized as meeting general education\n            requirements in the particular program.\nIn some instances, the course from the other institution may appear to meet the requirements for recognition as a general education course at Lambton College, but may not be \"substantially similar\" to any existing Lambton College course. (e.g. the\n            student may have completed an astronomy course from another institution, but Lambton offers no astronomy course) In this case, the course from the other institution will be reviewed by the Director, Institutional Intelligence & College Registrar to determine:\nif the course meets the requirements for recognition as a general education course (see above) and\nif there should be any associated program restrictions.\nIf the requirements for recognition as a general education course are met, and the grade received meets the threshold established in the\nPrior Learning Assessment & Recognition - Internal & External (2000-1-10) policy\n, than an AS grade will be awarded in the student's record with a generic course code, such as GED-1003.\nA student who has successfully completed an Ontario degree or Ontario College diploma or advanced diploma will automatically receive three general education course transfer credits upon entering a Lambton College diploma or advanced diploma program,\n            if the following conditions are met:\nThe student graduated from the previous program with an overall average equal to or greater than 63% or C;\nthe courses successfully completed as part of the previous diploma or degree include at least three courses that could be reasonably expected to broadly qualify as general education courses for the Lambton program that the student is entering;\n                    and,\nthe school from which the student graduated is known and recognized by Lambton College as a legitimate, credible institution of equivalent academic rigour as Lambton College.\nAppendix A\nProcedures Concerning General Education Courses\nAll courses designated as General Education courses will be under the auspices of, scheduled and delivered by one School.\nThe dean of the school, hereafter referred to as the GED dean, will be responsible for:\nmaintaining a full and varied inventory of current General Education courses,\nguiding the development of new General Education courses,\nsuspending or cancelling individual General Education courses,\nplanning, scheduling and delivering General Education courses,\nmonitoring and ensuring the quality of the General Education courses and their delivery.\nDevelopment of General Education Courses\nThe development of a course for general education purposes, or the approval of an existing course as a general education course, may be initiated by the GED dean, by the dean of any other school, or by any faculty member with the prior approval of their dean.\nAs well as individual initiation as above, annually, in September, the GED dean will issue a formal College-wide call for proposals for new General Education courses.\nThe call may identify a specific course to be developed, general education themes or topics to be addressed, or may be open.\nThe call will identify the time frame and any requirements for approval, development and initial delivery.\nThe call will identify the desired delivery format(s). i.e.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 4290, "end_char_idx": 9559, "text_template":

As part of the assurance of that quality, the College must know and ensure the appropriateness of the\n    content, delivery and evaluation in the courses that constitute the credential.\nThe College recognizes, however, that learning can and does take place outside of the College at other institutions and through life experience. The College formally recognizes that learning outside of its walls by granting credit towards a Lambton College\n    credential for courses and credentials from other institutions and experiential learning.\nIn order to balance the need for quality assurance and the recognition of external learning, Lambton College has established a residency requirement for each of its credentials. In order to receive a Lambton College credential, a student must complete\n    no less than the prescribed minimum proportion of the courses and credits required for the credential through courses that are recognized as resident courses for the credential.\nPolicy\nResidency Requirement\nFor every College credential a minimum number of the courses and credits required for the credential must be successfully completed through the College and recognized as resident courses.\nFor programs leading to certificate, diploma, advanced diploma and graduate certificate credentials, 25% or more of the courses and credits used to meet the graduation requirements for the credential must be resident courses and credits.\nA program may identify specific courses or course levels that must be part of the resident courses and credits.\nFor programs leading to a degree, 25% or more of the courses and credits used to meet the graduation requirements must be resident courses and credits.\nThe College will award no more than 50% of the program courses or credits through PLAR.\nA program may identify specific courses or course levels that must be part of the resident courses and credits.\nIn those degree programs that accept students on a program-to-program basis from preparatory programs or through bridging program arrangements, the resident courses and credits required of those students is a minimum of 25%. The specifics\n                            of the residency requirement for these students will be published by the program in its documents and on the website.\nAny exceptions to the College residency requirement must be approved by the Senior Vice-President, Academic & Student Success and published in the College calendar and website.\nResident Courses and Credits\nThe following courses and associated credits will be deemed to be resident.\nA Lambton College course instructed by Lambton College faculty is a resident course for all programs.\nA course delivered via OntarioLearn and deemed equivalent, by Lambton College, to a Lambton College course or a General Education Elective is considered a resident course for the Ontario College Certificate and Post-Graduate Certificate\n                    programs.\nA course delivered via OntarioLearn and deemed to be a degree-level non-core course by Lambton College is considered a resident course for a degree program.\nRecording of Grades and Credits for Courses\nFor a Lambton College course instructed by Lambton College faculty, the Lambton College course name and code and assigned letter grade will be recorded.\nFor a Lambton College course attempted through Prior Learning Assessment and Recognition (PLAR) and evaluated by Lambton College faculty, the Lambton College course name and code will be recorded; a letter grade will normally be assigned; a grade\n            of AS may be assigned.

Examples include, but are not limited to, adding, or reducing total program hours; adding, deleting, or substituting a course; and amending Work Integrated Learning requirements.\nMinor Curriculum Change\nA minor change is defined as a program curriculum revision that does not impact the requirements to graduate from a program. Examples include, but are not limited to, changing a course title; adjusting pre and co-requisites; and course sequencing or semester course delivery.\nPolicy\nThe Academic Dean has responsibility and accountability for curriculum content.\nProgram Builds and Major Curriculum Changes require the approval of the Senior Vice-President, Academic & Student Success.  Minor Curriculum Changes require the approval of the Academic Dean.\nProgram build and curriculum changes will be guided and informed by subject matter experts and may impact many stakeholders. The academic office will identify and ensure thorough and appropriate consultation throughout the program build or curriculum change process.\nCurriculum changes:\nMust benefit and not disadvantage students;\nMust align with:\nProgram vocational learning outcomes, general education, and essential employability skills;\nAny provincial program standards;\nAny requirements of external accrediting bodies\nFollow the process  as described in the Curriculum Build and Change Guide and posted on the internal site (hyperlink).\nThe development of new curriculum or revision of existing curriculum will also be conducted through an equity lens, specific to the course context. This includes ensuring that curriculum is up to date; relevant to the current context; supportive of the diversity, complexity and richness of human experience; and does not perpetuate negative stereotypes. The College is further committed to embedding Indigenous culture and history into its curriculum.\nCurriculum changes or program builds must be approved, and all curriculum documentation updated, by February 1 for implementation in the Fall term of the same year and impact the cohort beginning Term 1 on that date or later. Changes that result in a tightening of admissions requirements require 18 months between approval and cohort start. Curriculum changes past the established deadlines, or impacting prior term cohorts, require approval from the Senior Vice-President, Academic & Student Success.\nA list of required program documentation will be maintained by the Institutional Intelligence Office and posted on the\nmylambton website under the College Curriculum Committee\n. The Academic Office is responsible for ensuring all program documentation requirements are met.\nFor questions or concerns regarding this policy, please contact the\nPolicy Sponsor\nby phoning our main line 519-542-7751.\nSearch", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4041, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "51b6faa0-0a7d-46a1-bc5a-da7006b9e329": {"__data__": {"id_": "51b6faa0-0a7d-46a1-bc5a-da7006b9e329", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/nfs/nfs_dsw_phx2_prod/debajyotidasgupta6/chatbot/data/2000-2-2-post-secondary-timetabling.txt", "file_name": "2000-2-2-post-secondary-timetabling.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 13006, "creation_date": "2024-08-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-01"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "8c40bfee-1f01-4549-bb6a-585534daa3d7", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/nfs/nfs_dsw_phx2_prod/debajyotidasgupta6/chatbot/data/2000-2-2-post-secondary-timetabling.txt", "file_name": "2000-2-2-post-secondary-timetabling.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 13006, "creation_date": "2024-08-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-01"}, "hash": "192e57544b7a94f1f9e2c6491477233f2832bb717a271f5481799b30a658cff3", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "564228d1-ac66-4fc5-9823-1dd2ccc05c26", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "c0ffc82e4bf85c201ee7e26626b48e1c86719f45bebcce7b1f1e25e1353c8362", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "All Policies\n1000 Index, Circulation Lists, Amendments\n2000 Academic & Student Affairs\n3000 Personnel Administration\n4000 General Administration\n2000-2-2 Post-Secondary Timetabling\nResponsible Executive\nSenior Vice-President, Academic & Student Success\nPolicy Sponsor\nDirector, Institutional Intelligence & Registrar\nIssue Date\nAugust 15, 2019\nSupersedes Date\nJune 2, 2021\nLast Review\nApril 16, 2024\nLast Revision\nApril 16, 2016\nUpon request, the college will provide a copy of this policy in an alternate format.\nLambton College is committed to developing timetables that prioritize student success, while balancing the optimization and efficient use of College human and physical resources.\nPolicy\nThe academic concerns of the students (i.e. the teaching-learning process) are paramount in any timetabling process. Academic delivery must take precedence over any activity. Events that affect a substantial part of the College must be approved by\n            the Senior Vice President Academic.\nThe concept of \"timetabling the campus\" must be followed. Unless there are compelling reasons for assigning dedicated space, rooms and time must be allocated in the most efficient manner. Examples of compelling reasons include, but\n            are not limited to, specialized lab equipment and specialized software.\nRooms will be allocated to accommodate the various delivery modes and section sizes.\nDuring any periods of campus disruption (e.g. the addition or remodelling of classroom spaces), attempts will be made to timetable so that noise, etc. will not disrupt classes.\nConstraints and restrictions on the timetable impact the quality of the timetables and student success. Only necessary constraints will be imposed on a timetable and only when approved by the appropriate Dean.\nThe stability of the timetable is important, and changes should be minimized. Requests to make a timetable change must be approved by the Dean before submission to the scheduling office.\nIn cases in which there are unresolved conflicting requests, the Registrar will make the final decision.\nCreating quality timetables is a collaborative effort requiring all parties to meet the established deadlines for various processes.\nDouble booking of space is not an acceptable practice. The Dean's office will submit those exceptions that have been approved with their timetabling submissions.\nCommon hours (e.g. hours allocated for program meetings, student meetings, etc.) will be scheduled after timetables are completed. The scheduling staff may complete meeting requests, or the department may determine the time and request meeting space\n            from scheduling staff.\nThe Process\nScheduling software is used to automate and efficiently deliver academic schedules, validate against the student information system, generate course sections essential to course registration, produce grade reports, and provide statistical reports.\nTimetabling will be undertaken one term at a time.\nTable 1: Timetabling Schedule - tasks, responsibilities and deadlines\nTimetabling tasks, responsibilities and deadlines\nTask\nResponsibility\nFall\nWinter\nSpring\nEnrolment Projections\nRegistrar\nJan 22\nSep 23\nJan 29\nProgram Designation & Scheduling Requirements Finalized\nAcademic Offices, Scheduling Office\nMay 11\nNov 1\nFeb 9\nTimetables Issued to Departments\nScheduling Office\nJun 8\nNov 9\nMar 2\nTimetables Released to Faculty\nScheduling Office\nJun 15\nDec 4\nMar 8\nAdjustment Request Deadline\nAcademic Offices\nJun 29\nDec 9\nMar 16\nTimetable Publication\nScheduling Office\nJul 13\nDec 12\nMar 29\nTimetabling Responsibilities\nThe Deans have overall responsibility for ensuring that all data required from the academic departments are provided to the Registrar's Office by the specified deadlines, as well as approving constraints and timetable changes.\nThe Registrar will construct, publish, and distribute the College timetables in accordance with the guidelines and the timetabling schedule. The Registrar will discuss with the Deans any situation that does not comply. The above schedule outlines the\n            key milestones in the process.

Therefore, constraints that do not fall within the list of acceptable constraints or accommodations cannot be addressed.\nAcceptable constraints include, but are not limited to the following:\nPart-time faculty with specialized expertise but limited availability.\nConstraints that fall under the College's obligation to provide accommodation, short of undue hardship, under the Ontario Human Rights Code on any human rights protected ground, including religion, disability, sex, and family status. These constraints must be communicated to and approved by Human Resources, and only the timetabling impacts of the restriction will be communicated to the appropriate Dean and to the Scheduling Office.\nApproved duties within the SWF, including but not limited to Coordinator duties, committee work, etc. will be taken into consideration after the academic timetable is built.\nAll timetabling constraints not based in Ontario Human Rights Code criteria must be communicated to the Registrar's Office by the stipulated deadline. Medical constraints must be approved by Human Resources while all other constraints must be authorized by the\n            Dean.\nCollege Hour\nA consistent one-hour period (College Hour) shall be scheduled for faculty and students. Students and faculty will not be scheduled during the College Hour.\nRoom Restrictions\nIn consultation with the Registrar, the Deans will identify instructional space as general classroom, specialized but generally usable under certain conditions or unsuitable for general use.\nPriority use of a room will be provided where necessary.\nTravel\nIn cases where faculty or students must travel between campuses, travel time will be built into the timetable. Minimizing such travel will be a timetabling priority objective.\nDistribution of Course Delivery Times\nThe meetings of a given course will be distributed over the week as evenly as possible.\nUnless specified to the contrary, it will be considered acceptable to timetable different types of meetings (lecture, lab, etc.) on the same day.\nStudent timetables should be compact to minimize large gaps between classes.\nTimetable Structure\nIf possible, classes will be scheduled Monday to Friday, 8:30 a.m. to 6:30 p.m.\nTimetable Changes\nPrior to the issuance of the official timetables, a period of time will be allocated to problem-solve and fine-tune the timetables.

When scheduling,\n        the academic concerns, and therefore the primary academic timetable, takes precedence over any activity.\nActivities intended to supplement or complement the academic timetable can access available space as needed through a request via e-mail to\nroombookings@lambtoncollege.ca\n.\n The below guidelines will be followed when considering requests to ensure the fair use of limited physical space:\nBooking requests from students will not be accepted until after day 10 of each term to allow for room overflow.\nIf the open study area are inadequate, students must first try to book an alternate public space such as a study booth in the library.\nStudents are able to request and book classrooms and computer labs from 4:30 p.m. to 11 p.m. Monday to Friday and from 8 a.m. to 11 p.m. on Saturday and Sunday. Labs with specialized equipment are not permitted for use.\nIf a booking is requested by a group of students for the entire term,\nor\nif a space is being requested frequently by students of the same program, that space/a space will then become designated for that\nentire program\nfor the term. As to not monopolize classrooms, only 1 classroom/computer lab per program will be designated for the term; a second space for smaller groups of the same program will not be permitted. When a space is being requested for the entire\n            term (specific days and times), the request must then be approved by the Registrar or designate.\nIf more than one group of students or one program is requesting the same classroom/lab for specific reasons and an alternate location cannot be found, the time will be split or shared between them, regardless of who has requested the space first.\n            Fair and equal opportunity must be given to all students.\nStudents must request a space by emailing\nroombookings@lambtoncollege.ca\nat least 2 business days in advance of their date from their Lambton College email\n            account. Information must include:\nDate and time of room needed\nType of room needed\nDuration of time\nNames and student numbers of all students utilizing the room\nReason for request (see #2)\nIn return, they will receive the room rules document in the response from room bookings.\u00a0Requests made with less than 2 business days' notice may not be viewed in time and are at risk of not receiving a response.\nThe person(s) who booked the room have responsibility for ensuring the cleanliness of the room when the booking concludes.

The Quality Assurance Process will contribute to the efficient and effective\n    use of resources, and wise planning and budgeting.\nBoard policy requires that the College implement and continuously operate a comprehensive Quality Assurance Process. The Process will be in compliance with the Minister\u2019s Binding Directive, meet the requirements of the College Quality Assurance Audit\n    Process (CQAAP) and serve the quality assurance needs of Lambton College.\nPolicy\nThe Quality Assurance Process (Process) will be implemented by the College President and overseen by the Quality Assurance Council (Council), which is appointed by and reports to the President. The Quality Assurance Coordinator will operationalize the duties\n            and functions of the Council\nThe Process will cover all programs that lead to a Lambton College credential. All programs regardless of means of delivery (e.g. online, in classroom) or delivery provider (e.g. Lambton College, licensee) will be part of and subject to the Process.\nThe Process will be continuous in nature. All programs leading to a Lambton College credential will be subject to quality review on a continuous basis.\nA program delivered by Lambton College will undergo a Comprehensive Program Review every six years. In the third year between the comprehensive reviews, a guided self-review resulting in a Triennial Review report to\n                    the Programs & Services Committee of the Board of Governors will be completed.\nThe Process will be as objective as possible. Whenever possible, a review will be based on quantitative data, objective measures and standards, and analysis and comment from disinterested parties and peers.\nThe Process and individual reviews will be structured and conducted so as to be as efficient as possible.\u00a0 It is important that the use of College resources be minimized and onerous demands on any department be avoided.\nWhere an external accreditation process is available and undertaken, the Council may determine that the external accreditation process may wholly or partially replace the Comprehensive Program Review. For degree programs, the accreditation review\n            may replace the Program Evaluation Committee (PEC) review, in whole or in part, if the accreditation review is sufficiently similar to that of PEOAB and it covers most areas typically addressed in a PEC review.\nThe Annual Program Scorecard will be created each year by the Institutional Intelligence Office to inform program planning, including revitalization and potentially program suspension or cancellation. The Program Scorecard includes all full-time programs at Lambton College in Sarnia.\nCompletion of Triennial Reports will be the responsibility of individual departments. Support and guidance will be provided by Institutional Intelligence and Finance.\nComprehensive Program Reviews will be identified and scheduled by the Quality Assurance Coordinator. This schedule will be presented to and approved by the Council. Comprehensive Program Reviews will be conducted and supported by Institutional Intelligence.\nNew programs will be reviewed using the Triennial Report at the completion of the first iteration of the curriculum. The first Comprehensive Review will be scheduled one year later. The Implementation Report would be required from the Associate Dean/Dean,\n            one year following the completion of the Comprehensive Review. After this initial period of review, the program would follow the standard Triennial Review and Comprehensive Review schedule.\nThe Comprehensive Program Review and Triennial reports will include, where applicable, recommendations for quality improvement.\nImplementation Reports will be prepared by the Associate Dean/Dean responsible for the program describing the response to and the implementation of recommendations contained in the Comprehensive Program Review Report. Implementation Reports will be\n            submitted to the Quality Assurance Coordinator and the Council one year after the completion of the Comprehensive Review.\nAll program review reports and subsequent implementation report prepared for Lambton College delivered programs and submitted to the Council will be available in the Teaching & Learning Commons and available to the College community. Institutional\n            Intelligence will maintain on the QA website a current list of completed program reviews and a schedule of future program reviews.\nAnnually, the Council will report through the President to the Board on the Quality Assurance Process, describing reviews undertaken and completed, and the status of the recommendations contained in the reports of the previous year.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 5383, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9bd73db3-2896-42a3-8e4a-45d56d1dbd2b": {"__data__": {"id_": "9bd73db3-2896-42a3-8e4a-45d56d1dbd2b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/nfs/nfs_dsw_phx2_prod/debajyotidasgupta6/chatbot/data/2000-2-3-program-quality-assurance.txt", "file_name": "2000-2-3-program-quality-assurance.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 22273, "creation_date": "2024-08-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-01"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "7ccd2a5c-eb6f-40e9-b4b1-4771bfe4209c", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/nfs/nfs_dsw_phx2_prod/debajyotidasgupta6/chatbot/data/2000-2-3-program-quality-assurance.txt", "file_name": "2000-2-3-program-quality-assurance.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 22273, "creation_date": "2024-08-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-01"}, "hash": "1b366990e9ad3b29fe2d371d8d054e9f2fbb7df72b2597f265e300141e9c28d0", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "66ccc367-b5df-4522-88cf-f04eeb55049b", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/nfs/nfs_dsw_phx2_prod/debajyotidasgupta6/chatbot/data/2000-2-3-program-quality-assurance.txt", "file_name": "2000-2-3-program-quality-assurance.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 22273, "creation_date": "2024-08-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-01"}, "hash": "6cf91557891ad071c9305f05d23ab13fc6711d927b47e290268e3bf5ee065bbe", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "ef49098d-4224-484c-8c82-22c6fac0f928", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "804b9b8e2b1c9fec1ac3f4470c066c10e2086091f36e15d80c8d2765e30c9153", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "The Comprehensive Program Review and Triennial reports will include, where applicable, recommendations for quality improvement.\nImplementation Reports will be prepared by the Associate Dean/Dean responsible for the program describing the response to and the implementation of recommendations contained in the Comprehensive Program Review Report.

Cancellation\nLast Review\nApril 16, 2024\nLast Revision\nApril 16, 2024\nUpon request, the college will provide a copy of this policy in an alternate format.\nLambton College commits to providing a range of credentials and programs of instruction that meet the needs of students, employers, and the community.\u00a0 As the needs of our stakeholders change over time, Lambton College strives to respond by introducing new programs, revitalizing, and updating our current programs, and, in some cases, suspending an intake or cancelling a program.\nThis policy guides these suspension and cancellation decisions, and ensures that the associated processes are:\nBased on evidence\nFormalized, documented, and consistent\nRespectful and timely\nPolicy\nProgram Intake Suspension\nProgram intake suspension will be based on assessment of program applications and/or confirmations for a specific intake term, when the numbers are sufficiently below the enrolment plan such that the delivery is unviable from an academic or financial perspective.\nProgram intake suspension is proposed by the program Dean to the Enrolment Management Committee, which reviews the proposal and recommends suspension to the Executive Management Team for approval.\nThe Executive Management Team will make the decision to suspend an intake as early as possible within the admissions cycle in order to minimize impact to applicants and prospective applicants.\nIn the case of program intake suspension, the Senior Director, Community Engagement will be responsible for the development and execution of a formal communications plan.\nProgram Intake Reactivation\nPrograms need to be formally reactivated when all intakes in a previous academic year were suspended. Programs with multiple intakes, which maintained at least one intake, do not need to be formally reactivated.\nInstitiutional Intelligence will maintain a list of programs requiring formal reactivation, and will provide a report to each Academic Dean of programs requiring formal reactivation, in June - 14 months prior to the academic year. For example, programs requiring formal reactivation will be provided in June 2024 for the 2025-2026 academic year.\nThe Academic Dean will bring a proposal to reactivate a program to the Enrolment Management Committee by September - 12 months prior to the academic year. For exampe, the proposal to activate a program in 2025-2026 academic year will be brought to Enrolment Management Committee by September 2024.\nThe Enrolment Management Committee will review the proposal and, if endorsed, make recommendation for the reactivation to the Senior Vice-President, Academic & Student Success, who will make the final decision.\nAs per the Ministry of Colleges & Universities Program Suspension & Cancellation Operating Procedure, programs that have been cancelled will be reactivated but require a new funding approval application.\nProgram Cancellation\nThe decision to cancel a program will be based on, but not limited to, one or more of the following factors:\nProgram performance on the annual program scorecard\nFinancial viability\nPrior attempts to update and/or revitalize the program\nAlignment with the institutional mandate and strategic plan\nConsistent intake suspensions - any funded program suspended for five years would automatically be cancelled as per Ministry of Colleges and Universities policy.\nProgram cancellation will be proposed by the dean to the Senior Vice-President, Academic & Student Success, including documented rationale for the proposal.

of programs to advise the Board of Governors and the college regarding the program(s).\nThe Board of Governors shall appoint members of the Program Advisory Committees (PACs) that are representative of the employers, professions, and industry sector(s) that each program serves.\nTerms of Reference\nThe purpose of the PACs is to identify and suggest new programs and courses and to consider, review and suggest changes and revisions in existing programs and courses, thus ensuring programs offered by the college meet the changing needs of the labour\n            market.\nMore particularly, PACs will offer advice regarding program learning outcomes, curriculum, facilities, clinical and field experience, co-op and work experience, placement opportunities, effectiveness of graduates, and community needs.\nPACs will provide a liaison with the community for the dissemination of information about the program, the development of scholarships and bursaries, recruitment of students and the placement of graduates, and for the college to disseminate relevant\n            information to our community members.\nPACs are advisory and not administrative or executive in nature and are not in any way responsible for the allocation and utilization of College resources.\nMembership\nThe Program Advisory Councils shall be composed of the following:\nThe external membership list is to include

There may be exceptions to the nine-year limit appointment if no replacement members are available or due to programming with highly specialized fields.\nWhen a new PAC is formed, the first members shall commence their respective terms upon their appointment and their terms shall be set to expire on August 31 within each of the following three years of their appointment in rotation.\nAny vacancy occurring during the term of a member shall be filled on a recommendation of the Program & Services Committee of the Lambton College Board of Governors and appointment by the Board.\nMeetings\nPACs shall meet a minimum of two times per year, preferably once in each post-secondary term. The PAC will determine the need for more meetings.\nWhen an external member does not attend any advisory committee meetings within an academic year, the committee may declare the membership void and replace the member.\nOperations\nThe Chairperson of a PAC for the next year will be elected annually at the last meeting of the academic year from non-college members as defined in 7a.\nThe Chair, in consultation with the Dean or Associate Dean of the program(s), is responsible for establishing the agendas for the committee meetings.\nThe Dean or Associate Dean's Academic Administrative Assistant is responsible for arranging meetings as required by the committee, ensuring that the committee membership list is current and submitted to the Board of Governors office.\nMinutes shall be kept of each committee meeting and will be distributed by the Dean or Associate Dean's Academic Administrative Assistant to each member prior to the next meeting.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 5022, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "901370f2-250a-4485-b43a-0f74498985f0": {"__data__": {"id_": "901370f2-250a-4485-b43a-0f74498985f0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/nfs/nfs_dsw_phx2_prod/debajyotidasgupta6/chatbot/data/2000-2-6-program-advisory-committees.txt", "file_name": "2000-2-6-program-advisory-committees.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 8179, "creation_date": "2024-08-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-01"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "bcbece61-a7af-462c-bc78-fbbffbaa64cf", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/nfs/nfs_dsw_phx2_prod/debajyotidasgupta6/chatbot/data/2000-2-6-program-advisory-committees.txt", "file_name": "2000-2-6-program-advisory-committees.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 8179, "creation_date": "2024-08-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-01"}, "hash": "f396251b949ce06a4a1311423d57097ce1aee99078a4c1f708c38cc8a13dce92", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "f3268885-3b99-4364-8901-9501aac72516", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/nfs/nfs_dsw_phx2_prod/debajyotidasgupta6/chatbot/data/2000-2-6-program-advisory-committees.txt", "file_name": "2000-2-6-program-advisory-committees.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 8179, "creation_date": "2024-08-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-01"}, "hash": "a96370edff0aab8bdb33828672e28931fc9a5bc6d741cc6f899326d34a685205", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Meetings\nPACs shall meet a minimum of two times per year, preferably once in each post-secondary term.

This policy is intended to ensure that\nresearch\n[2]\nis conducted ethically, the rights of human participants in research are respected and protected, and research is conducted in a manner consistent with the guidelines and standards of the\nTri-Council Policy Statement: Ethical Conduct for Research Involving Humans\n(TCPS2)\n[3]\n. Further, this policy will guide the Research Ethics Board (REB) and researchers in the protection of human research participants and their rights.\nPolicy\nScope\nThis policy, and its provisions and requirements, apply to all research involving human participants\nconducted by College employees and students, or\nconducted on Lambton College premises, whether or not by a College employee or student,\nfunded or unfunded,\nunless explicitly excluded or exempted by this policy.\nIt is the responsibility of any researcher associated in any way with Lambton College, e.g. full-time employee, contract employee, unpaid associate, volunteer, etc., who anticipates undertaking or, in any way being engaged with, or associated with\n        research of any type involving human participants to ensure that the research has been reported to and considered by the Lambton College REB before undertaking or participating in any way in the research.\nFurther, it is the responsibility of every Lambton College manager to ensure that any research involving human participants has been reported to, considered by and approved by the REB, or been deemed by the REB not to require its approval, before\n        approving the commencement or the funding of the research.\nThe applicability of this policy to any research in any way associated with, linked or related to Lambton College will be determined by the REB. The REB must be informed of any research to be undertaken under the conditions described above in order\n        for it to determine the applicability of this policy to the research.\nThe scope of this policy and the authority of the REB do not extend to the validity or value of the research as a scholarly undertaking or its potential for making a meaningful contribution to a scholarly body of work. Notwithstanding this statement,\n        if the REB is particularly concerned about an egregious imbalance between the (apparent lack of) scholarly value of some research and the costs, or potential costs, imposed on the human participants or the College, the REB has a moral obligation\n        to forward its concerns to the College manager overseeing the research or the President.\nCompliance with the Tri-Council Policy Statement (TCPS2)\nAll research conducted within or associated with Lambton College that involves human participants must comply with the standards stipulated in the TCPS2. As well, the TCPS2 will provide guidance to the REB and researchers. A link to the TCPS2 is provided\n        in the appendix.\nIf an inconsistency or conflict arises between this policy and the TCPS2, this policy shall take precedence, unless determined otherwise by the REB.\nAll principle investigators, researchers, including student researchers, and REB members are required to complete the TCPS2 Tutorial Course on Research Ethics (CORE), or any successor to it. Proof of completion of the course by all involved researchers\n        is a prerequisite for approval of their research, and by members of the REB as a prerequisite for participation in REB deliberations. In some circumstances, students involved in the conduct of course-based research may not be required to obtain\n        TCPS-2 certificates.

One of the key action items of the Plan is to clarify the commercialization mandates of post-secondary institutions. In response, the Ministry of Colleges and Universities released a Commercialization\n        Mandate Policy Framework in early 2022 directing each post-secondary institution to develop a Commercialization Policy focused on the objective of harnessing the intellectual property generated with the institution\u2019s resources so as to achieve Ontario\u2019s\n        goal of ensuring that made-in-Ontario innovations benefit Ontarians.\nUnder the Ontario Colleges of Applied Arts and Technology Act, 2002, the objects of Lambton College (the \u201cCollege\u201d) are to offer a comprehensive program of career-oriented, post-secondary education and training to assist individuals in finding and keeping\n        employment, to meet the needs of employers and the changing work environment and to support the economic and social development of their local and diverse communities. The Act further provides that in carrying out its objects, the College may undertake\n        a range of education-related and training-related activities, including applied research. It is within such context that the College involves its students, faculty and other staff in Applied Research projects, notably through the rendering of Applied\n        Research services to Third-Party Commercial Entities (TPCEs). Through its applied research activities, the College, along with all other Canadian colleges, plays a critical role in supporting small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), fostering competitiveness\n        and innovation, and contributing to Ontario\u2019s economic growth.\nThis policy provides a framework for the College\u2019s role of supporting TPCEs and facilitating the commercialization of Arising IP by them.\nThis policy has been developed within the unique applied research funding context for Ontario colleges. The operating funding provided to colleges by the province is designed to support the core education and training mandate of colleges and does not\n        reflect the overhead costs of exploring, developing and overseeing applied research projects. These costs must be met through other revenue sources. Funding from granting agencies, primarily federal agencies, is crucial for the College to undertake\n        specific applied research projects. These projects increase innovation at the community and regional level by enabling the College to work with companies to develop solutions to specific business and technical challenges. With the help of such funding,\n        the College can actively engage in Applied Research and collaborations that can lead to the commercialization, as well as technology transfer, adaptation and adoption, of new technologies by TPCEs.\nThis policy is to be reviewed no less than five years in order to reflect the College\u2019s experience with Intellectual Property and with other participants in the innovation ecosystem.\nPolicy\nPurpose & Scope\nThe College has developed this policy in conformity with the requirements of the Commercialization Mandate Policy Framework, giving due consideration to the specificities of research in a college environment, the College\u2019s other policies relating\n            to Intellectual Property and the current legislative framework. By adopting this policy, the College aims to foster an environment in which the commercialization potential for the Intellectual Property derived from Applied Research services rendered\n            to TPCEs can be maximized for the benefit of Ontarians.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4579, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "56fc111d-0da7-4cfd-afef-ae0bbdfefa50": {"__data__": {"id_": "56fc111d-0da7-4cfd-afef-ae0bbdfefa50", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/nfs/nfs_dsw_phx2_prod/debajyotidasgupta6/chatbot/data/2000-3-10-commercialization-policy-for-ontario-colleges.txt", "file_name": "2000-3-10-commercialization-policy-for-ontario-colleges.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 22074, "creation_date": "2024-08-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-01"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "321517ed-1309-4c85-9e5e-42fa19a26772", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/nfs/nfs_dsw_phx2_prod/debajyotidasgupta6/chatbot/data/2000-3-10-commercialization-policy-for-ontario-colleges.txt", "file_name": "2000-3-10-commercialization-policy-for-ontario-colleges.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 22074, "creation_date": "2024-08-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-01"}, "hash": "62d47140687153b5ff6b6ef7f58afa3e7475d7ad3c86e0230880560994205994", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "c00129a7-1b12-4661-ba41-5407aea04048", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/nfs/nfs_dsw_phx2_prod/debajyotidasgupta6/chatbot/data/2000-3-10-commercialization-policy-for-ontario-colleges.txt", "file_name": "2000-3-10-commercialization-policy-for-ontario-colleges.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 22074, "creation_date": "2024-08-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-01"}, "hash": "2eec9774943cb9494c83fca9ec2df5fd2195250ddd844d0db0623cd27844f448", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "dea0b349-ca9d-4b2b-9036-baad9b06687e", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "8b045f87e4ca7d44adfba4855627edab61c8cf53693dd02d4e91f409a1592b2c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "With the help of such funding,\n        the College can actively engage in Applied Research and collaborations that can lead to the commercialization, as well as technology transfer, adaptation and adoption, of new technologies by TPCEs.\nThis policy is to be reviewed no less than five years in order to reflect the College\u2019s experience with Intellectual Property and with other participants in the innovation ecosystem.\nPolicy\nPurpose & Scope\nThe College has developed this policy in conformity with the requirements of the Commercialization Mandate Policy Framework, giving due consideration to the specificities of research in a college environment, the College\u2019s other policies relating\n            to Intellectual Property and the current legislative framework. By adopting this policy, the College aims to foster an environment in which the commercialization potential for the Intellectual Property derived from Applied Research services rendered\n            to TPCEs can be maximized for the benefit of Ontarians. More specifically, by adopting this Policy, the College seeks to achieve the following:\nPromote the appropriate use and protection of IP arising from the College\u2019s research activities\nMaximize the socioeconomic benefits to Canada and Ontario of such IP\nPromote individual and collective compliance with College and third-party expectations with regards to applicable legislation and regulations\nDefine the roles and responsibilities of the various stakeholders in the management of Arising IP\nPromote the use and dissemination of research results in subsequent teaching or research activities at the College\nThis policy applied to:\nAll staff members, whether employees or contractors, of the College\nAll students of the College involved in paid research activities as part of their curriculum who generate Intellectual Property in the course of government-funded Applied Research activities. Other Intellectual Property, for example, copyright\n                    in literary works, authored by the foregoing persons, is addressed in the College\u2019s\nIntellectual Property for Research Activities (2000-3-4)\npolicy.\nGeneral Principles\nIP Policy\nThis policy is to be read in conjunction with the\nIntellectual Property for Research Activities (2000-3-4)\npolicy, which addresses the ownership of intellectual property developed by its employees and students.\nDisclosure\nAll creators have an obligation to promptly disclose to the College Intellectual Property with commercial potential. The College shall establish a procedure to facilitate such disclosure to the R&I Office or TPCE. This may include the use of a disclosure\n            form, or it may be included in a report provided to the TPCE that describes the Invention or other IP, the Creators, and any existing agreements related to the Invention or other IP. For clarity, such disclosure is not considered Public Disclosure.\nGiven that the responsibility to disclose vests with individuals, the College will educate potential creators on the importance of thorough and timely disclosure.\nNon-Disclosure\nWhile disclosure of IP is important, non-disclosure of IP is equally so. creators should be aware that Public Disclosure may result in loss of IP protection rights. This is especially true of Inventions as, generally speaking, a patent is difficult\n            or impossible to obtain if Public Disclosure of the Invention has occurred. Care must therefore be taken to avoid premature disclosure before a patent application has been filed. In light of this, Creators are strongly encouraged to make all reasonable\n            efforts to identify any protectable IP as early as possible and consult the R&I Office before making any Public Disclosure of IP.\nConfidentiality\nPartnerships and research collaborations with TPCEs often involve the communication by them of confidential proprietary information, some of which is likely to implicate Intellectual Property. Any Applied Research Services Agreement must contain confidentiality\n            clauses, and any College employees and students must be made aware of such confidentiality provisions to ensure that they are respected.\nPersons engaged in research shall treat as confidential all information received in the context of research activities that is designated as confidential by the party disclosing it or protected by a confidentiality clause. This is especially important\n            in the context of an Invention that could be patented, since a patent cannot be obtained if there has been public disclosure of the Invention.\nTPCEs may require individuals within the College community to sign non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) as additional protection, often prior to the College and the TPCE entering into an Applied Research Services Agreement. In such case, unless the NDA\n            contains clauses that cannot be considered \u201cstandard\u201d, the individual shall be required to sign the NDA as a condition of participating in the project to indicate their acknowledgement of the NDA terms.\nFinally, where the R&I Office believes that Intellectual Property belonging to the College, or which the College licenses from a third party, may be divulged in the course of research activities, the College will request the TPCE to sign a non-disclosure\n            agreement.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 3560, "end_char_idx": 8869, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "dea0b349-ca9d-4b2b-9036-baad9b06687e": {"__data__": {"id_": "dea0b349-ca9d-4b2b-9036-baad9b06687e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/nfs/nfs_dsw_phx2_prod/debajyotidasgupta6/chatbot/data/2000-3-10-commercialization-policy-for-ontario-colleges.txt", "file_name": "2000-3-10-commercialization-policy-for-ontario-colleges.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 22074, "creation_date": "2024-08-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-01"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "321517ed-1309-4c85-9e5e-42fa19a26772", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/nfs/nfs_dsw_phx2_prod/debajyotidasgupta6/chatbot/data/2000-3-10-commercialization-policy-for-ontario-colleges.txt", "file_name": "2000-3-10-commercialization-policy-for-ontario-colleges.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 22074, "creation_date": "2024-08-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-01"}, "hash": "62d47140687153b5ff6b6ef7f58afa3e7475d7ad3c86e0230880560994205994", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "56fc111d-0da7-4cfd-afef-ae0bbdfefa50", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/nfs/nfs_dsw_phx2_prod/debajyotidasgupta6/chatbot/data/2000-3-10-commercialization-policy-for-ontario-colleges.txt", "file_name": "2000-3-10-commercialization-policy-for-ontario-colleges.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 22074, "creation_date": "2024-08-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-01"}, "hash": "3d19af8a042e687a52b13c36df55ae78117d635579cf4b6cb2152199420580d9", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "41c68392-10a0-4656-bf25-4069eff79712", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "27fa363d2f450de517bcfd84c26032341c1988de3e7b53f35fe10831788c4a35", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "This is especially important\n            in the context of an Invention that could be patented, since a patent cannot be obtained if there has been public disclosure of the Invention.\nTPCEs may require individuals within the College community to sign non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) as additional protection, often prior to the College and the TPCE entering into an Applied Research Services Agreement.

As a matter of practice however, the NDA which the TPCE is asking the College to sign may offer the parties mutual protection.\nUse of Proper Binding Agreement\nRegardless of the Commercialization Pathway ultimately chosen Applied Research Services Agreements that could result in the creation of new Intellectual Property must be documented in a written contract which:\nprotects the interests of the College, faculty and staff, and students, for example by minimizing the potential for, and the consequences of, a breach of the agreement and saves it harmless from future IP-related claims; and\nretains rights for the College to use the IP for educational and research purposes.\nIn all instances, the contract shall explicitly or implicitly provide that the decision to commercialize Arising IP will rest with the TPCE.\nRights Retained\nThe College must endeavour to maintain the right to use any Arising IP resulting from an Applied Research Services Agreement for internal academic and teaching purposes, including for the purposes of enhancing curriculum relating to the subject matter\n            thereof and of providing case studies and examples of research-derived IP and the management thereof.\nRoles & Responsibilities\nThe College\nAs an institution supporting and facilitating the commercialization of Intellectual Property created in Ontario, the College\u2019s role is to ensure that intellectual property created with the use of its physical and human resources (i.e., Arising IP)\n            will be identified, protected from disclosure and transferred to TPCEs or, if so directed by them, to third-parties who are capable of assessing the IP\u2019s commercial potential.\nResearch & Innovation Office\nThe R&I Office is responsible for the administration of all matters relating to IP at the College.

All licensing arrangements can be contractually limited by geographical locations, time, industry and fields of application.\nIn order to maximize benefits to Ontarians, the College shall endeavour to grant non-exclusive licenses, and preference shall be given to small and medium-sized enterprises. In determining the type and terms of a license, the College shall consider\n                the likelihood that the Licensee will be able to bring the licensed IP to market.\nSome of the different forms of license, and other important licensing terminology, are the following:\nCross-License\n- A license two or more Intellectual Property owners contractually authorise each other to use their Intellectual Property for commercial and non-commercial purposes. Cross-licensing terms may include the payment\n                        of a licensee fee or royalty if the rights conveyed by the parties are not equal in value\nExclusive License\n- A license whereby the licensor transfers all rights of exploitation of the Intellectual Property to the licensee. This means that the licensor relinquishes the rights to exploit the Intellectual Property\n                        itself, or to grant any additional, subsequent license(s) to another party\nLicense or License Agreement\n- A contract under which the holder of IP (the Licensor) grants permission for the use of its IP to another person (the Licensee), within the limits set by the provisions of the contract. The Licensor\n                        retains ownership of the IP and is therefore responsible for any on-going prosecution of the IP and maintenance of IP rights\nLicensee\n- The recipient of a license\nLicensor\n- The provider of a license\nNon-Exclusive License\n- A license whereby the Licensor may grant the rights of exploitation of the Intellectual Property to one or more party(ies), including the right to exploit the Intellectual Property itself. In a non-exclusive\n                        license, the Licensor may grant the Licensee sub-licensing rights\nSole License\n- A license whereby the Licensor transfers all rights of exploitation of the Intellectual Property to the Licensee but retains its rights to exploit the Intellectual Property itself\nAssignment\n- The College transfers complete ownership to another party (the \u201cAssignee\u201d).

It involves the awareness and application of established professional norms, as well as values and ethical principles\n        that are essential in the performance of all activities related to research. These values include honesty, fairness, trust, accountability, and openness.\nLambton College (herein after referred to as College) recognizes the importance of integrity in research and so strives to ensure the realization of high standards of research integrity. The College will promote integrity in research by creating and supporting\n        an environment in which researchers, scholars, students, and employees are aware of the importance of integrity in research, are able to achieve the highest standards of research integrity and are expected to do so.\nIntegrity in research goes beyond the avoidance of wrongdoing. Integrity also requires adherence to the highest standards of intellectual honesty, appropriate research methodology, ethical standards of discipline, the careful supervision of research,\n        and the refusal to engage in or condone fraud or misconduct.\nScope\nThis policy has been developed to ensure compliance with the Tri-Agency Framework: Responsible Conduct of Research and applies to any employee or student of the College and any other individual in any capacity in research at, or associated with the College\n        (hereinafter referred to as Researchers.)\nObjective\nThe objectives of this policy are to:\nEnsure that funding decisions are made based on correct and reliable information;\nensure public funds are used diligently and in accordance with funding agreements;\npromote and protect the research work funded by the agencies;\npromote fairness in the conduct of research and the process for addressing claims related to the breach of policy.\nResponsibilities of Researchers\nAll the Researchers engaged expressly or implied in research work or applying or receiving any agency funds shall comply with the policy.\nPromotion of Research Integrity\nResearchers involved in research are expected to be aware of the College policy on research integrity and are expected to follow the best research practices honestly, accountability, openly, and fairly in the search for and in dissemination of knowledge.\n            In addition, all employees and students involved in research are required to undertake professional development on the College research policies prior to beginning any research project.\nAt a minimum, the responsibility of Researchers shall include the following, but are not limited to:\nRigour\n- while recording, evaluating, and interpreting data and in reporting and publishing data and findings, Researchers are expected to use high level of rigour.\nRecord Keeping\n- scientific and scholarly inquiry is dependent upon the integrity of accurately recorded data. Researchers must retain the original and accurate records of data, methodologies, and findings, including graphs\n                    and images not only to ensure the integrity and credibility of the data but to also allow verification or replication of the work by others.\nAccurate Referencing, Authorship & Acknowledgement\n- to ensure the accurate publication of scholarly reports, two requirements must be met:\nthe active participation of each author in verifying and taking responsibility for the part of the manuscript that she has contributed; and\nthe designation of one author who is responsible for the validity of the entire manuscript.\nThe principal criterion for authorship should be that each author has made a significant intellectual and practical contribution. The concept of honorary authorship is unacceptable. Student shall be given the appropriate recognition for authorship\n            or data collection in any publication.

Sanctions may include, but are not limited to, any of the following, individually or in combination:\nRestitution - repair, replace and/or restore any damaged or lost materials\nVerbal reprimand with specifics related to the infraction\nWritten reprimand placed in the employees file with the specifics related to the nature of the infraction and consequences should an infraction occur again\nRepayment of any resources misappropriated\nA fine\nSuspension\nDismissal from employment\nThe respondent may appeal the sanction or disciplinary actions to the President of the College within five working days of receiving notification of the sanction or disciplinary action. The President will consider the appeal and confirm or amend the\n            sanction or disciplinary action. The President will notify the respondent within five working days of receiving the appeal.\nIn cases where a breach of the Research Integrity policy has involved the College faculty or support staff and a sanction or disciplinary action has occurred, the faculty member or support staff member retains the right to appeal the sanction or disciplinary\n            action, but not the decision of the Investigation Panel, through the relevant Collective Agreement.\nExternal Reporting Requirements\nSubject to any applicable laws, including privacy laws, the College shall advise the relevant Agency or SRCR immediately of any allegations related to activities funded by the Agency. The College shall inform SRCR whether or not the College is proceeding\n            with an investigation.\nIf a breach is confirmed, the College shall submit a report to SRCR and the relevant Agency on each investigation conducted in response to the breach.\nSubject to any applicable laws, including privacy laws, each report shall include:\nthe specific allegation(s), a summary of the finding(s) and reasons for the finding(s);\nthe process and time lines followed for the inquiry and/or investigation;\nthe researcher\u2019s response to the allegation, investigation and findings, and any measures the researcher has taken to rectify the breach; and\nthe College investigation committee\u2019s decisions and recommendations\nThe College shall submit an inquiry letter to the SRCR, within two months of receipt of an allegation whether or not misconduct is concluded to have occurred.\nIf the investigation was initiated and where misconduct is found to have occurred, the College shall have additional five months following the end of the inquiry to conduct an investigation and submit its report to the SRCR. Hence, the College is\n            expected to submit its report within seven months from the date of receipt of allegation.\nThe above-mentioned timelines may be extended under exceptional circumstances and in consultation with SCRS.\nThe College shall send updates to the SRCR at such time interval as may be decided between SCRC and the College.\nThe College and the Researcher shall not enter into any agreements that may prevent the College from reporting to the Agencies through the SRCR.\nIn cases where the source of funding is unclear, the SRCR has right to request information and reports from the College.\nRecords\nReports and records will be kept by the Human Resources Department. See\nRecords Retention (1000-1-3) policy\n.\nAccess to investigation records will be by application to the Director, Human Resources. Development Access to records pertaining to the investigation will be restricted to the President, Senior Vice-President, Academic & Student Success, Vice-President,\n            Research & Innovation, the Director, Human Resources, the respondent and his/her department head. The College will conform to the Ontario Freedom of Information Act in such applications.\nBreaches of Policy by the College\nIn accordance with the Agreement signed by the Agencies and the College, the Agencies require the College to Comply with Agency policies as a condition of eligibility to apply for and administer Agency funds.

Its fundamental tenet is that members of the College community should, of their own volition, disclose situations that give rise\n    to a real or potential or perceived conflict of interest.\nThe mere existence of a conflict or a potential conflict of interest does not necessarily imply that the research activity should cease. Conflicts cover a broad spectrum from those that are minor and easily controlled or contained to those that may have\n    very serious consequences. There are situations sufficiently complex that opinions or judgments may differ as to whether or not a conflict exists. Accordingly, any member of the College with a real or potential or perceived conflict of interest related\n    to research activities has a responsibility to disclose the situation and details, and seek the advice, guidance and direction of the College.\nPolicy\nNo researcher or research administrator shall engage in activities that create a conflict of interest.\nNotwithstanding the above, where approval of an activity - for which a real or potential or perceived conflict of interest has been disclosed or revealed - has been sought and received from the person with the authority to grant such approval - the\n            activity shall be deemed not to be a conflict of interest, or not to be a significant or unacceptable conflict of interest, or to be a sufficiently contained conflict of interest.\nWhen a real or potential or perceived conflict of interest arises, the individual in conflict has a duty and is required to disclose the situation to the Executive Dean, Applied Research and Innovation.\nWhen a real or potential or perceived conflict of interest comes to the attention of, or becomes apparent to, a third-party individual, that individual is ethically obliged and is required to report the conflict of interest to the Executive Dean,\n            Applied Research and Innovation.\nAny researcher or other individual involved with research who is aware of, or could be reasonably expected to be aware of, or is concerned with, a real or potential conflict of interest, or the perception of it, must report the matter to the Executive\n            Dean, Applied Research and Innovation.\nFailure to report a conflict of interest will result in appropriate action by the College, including disciplinary action up to and including dismissal.\nConflict of Interest\nA conflict of interest or a potential conflict of interest exists when a member of the College is in, or may be in, a position to use research, knowledge, authority or influence for personal or family gain or to benefit others with a personal connection,\n            to the detriment of the institution or its research partners or clients. [1]\nA conflict of interest arises when an individual's private, personal or commercial interests may be incompatible, or in conflict, with his/her responsibilities as a researcher or research administrator when the individual has the opportunity to advance\n            or protect his/her own interests, or the interests of others with whom he/she has a relationship, in a way that is detrimental to the interests of the College or its research partners or clients, or potentially harmful to the integrity or mission\n            of the College.\nTypes of Conflict of Interest\nConflicts of interest may be individual or institutional.\nAn individual conflict can be defined as any external activity or undertaking that places an individual in a position that:\ninfluences College research, education or business for personal gain or the gain of others with whom there is a personal, or potential personal, relationship, or\ninterferes with or prevents the discharge of his/her College responsibilities, as defined by the individual's employment contract; this is, in reality, a conflict of commitment.\nThe overall direction of this definition is that the best interests of the College, or its research clients or partners, may be compromised to the personal benefit of the individual employee.\nIndividual conflicts of interest often derive\n                        directly or indirectly from opportunities to participate in externally-funded research and in a subsequent interplay between the results of the research and a faculty member's personal or financial interests.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 5010, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "bb43d49b-0a12-4963-8447-6fa23c1515d9": {"__data__": {"id_": "bb43d49b-0a12-4963-8447-6fa23c1515d9", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/nfs/nfs_dsw_phx2_prod/debajyotidasgupta6/chatbot/data/2000-3-3-research-conflict-of-interest.txt", "file_name": "2000-3-3-research-conflict-of-interest.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 13338, "creation_date": "2024-08-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-01"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "beb71b2b-3a51-4b22-891f-6a981bd76c8f", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/nfs/nfs_dsw_phx2_prod/debajyotidasgupta6/chatbot/data/2000-3-3-research-conflict-of-interest.txt", "file_name": "2000-3-3-research-conflict-of-interest.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 13338, "creation_date": "2024-08-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-01"}, "hash": "f4b9130f48660d5781dc086952da8f5128081f885a78fb285f9b9befa95907d9", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "2d0d9ad6-1dd4-4547-bae6-7b35c85773a9", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/nfs/nfs_dsw_phx2_prod/debajyotidasgupta6/chatbot/data/2000-3-3-research-conflict-of-interest.txt", "file_name": "2000-3-3-research-conflict-of-interest.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 13338, "creation_date": "2024-08-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-01"}, "hash": "b821f35bdd4e28733d0f5d3da727e73f42b751360768e632e94b8dca07aec4ab", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "dda04c52-03bf-428a-a025-cd35315ba28b", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "53716eefbe77eedc7169db7b8fa0995d1b799b845a88883c92033e75db264433", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Types of Conflict of Interest\nConflicts of interest may be individual or institutional.\nAn individual conflict can be defined as any external activity or undertaking that places an individual in a position that:\ninfluences College research, education or business for personal gain or the gain of others with whom there is a personal, or potential personal, relationship, or\ninterferes with or prevents the discharge of his/her College responsibilities, as defined by the individual's employment contract; this is, in reality, a conflict of commitment.\nThe overall direction of this definition is that the best interests of the College, or its research clients or partners, may be compromised to the personal benefit of the individual employee.\nIndividual conflicts of interest often derive\n                        directly or indirectly from opportunities to participate in externally-funded research and in a subsequent interplay between the results of the research and a faculty member's personal or financial interests. Such situations frequently place\n                        faculty and staff members in a position to manage contracts, select equipment and supplies, involve graduate students in sponsored research or play administrative roles that demand the utmost in integrity and honesty. Even the appearance of\n                        an apparent conflict can have a negative impact on the College and the individual in the eyes of the College and the broader community.\nInstitutional conflicts of interest may occur when the College enters into contractual relationships with external bodies, usually private corporations but sometimes government agencies, that bring it into potential conflict with its mandate,\n                    with the personal activities of the members of its Board of Governors or even its status as an educational institution. These potential institutional conflicts must be monitored by the governing body of the College.\nManaging Conflict of Interest\nAll disclosures of a real, potential or perceived conflict of interest shall be reported - in writing - to, and investigated by, the Executive Dean, Applied Research and Innovation.\nThe Executive Dean, Applied Research and Innovation, in consultation with the Applied Research and department staff including the Research Operations Manager, will determine whether a conflict, real or potential, exists.\nIn the event that a conflict:\nExists or potentially exists, the Executive Dean, Applied Research and Innovation, will establish and direct a course of action to remove, avoid, limit, contain or monitor the conflict, after which written documentation of the directive will\n                    be held by the researcher or individual, the Research Operations Manager, the Executive Dean and the supervisor of the Executive Dean.\nIs real or potential, is found not to exist by the Executive Dean, Applied Research and Innovation, written documentation of that decision will be provided to and held by the researcher or individual, the Research Operations Manager, the Executive\n                    Dean and the supervisor of the Executive Dean.\nIn the event that the above decision of the Executive Dean is unacceptable to the researcher or individual,

Date\nOctober 15, 2007\nSupersedes Date\nOctober 15, 2007\nLast Review\nApril 7, 2021\nLast Revision\nNovember 7, 2019\nUpon request, the college will provide a copy of this policy in an alternate format.\nUpon request, the college will provide a copy of this policy in an alternate format.\nLambton College\u2019s policy on Intellectual Property for Research Activities was adapted from material from George Brown College, BCIT, Seneca College, Tufts University and Ohio State University.\nPolicy\nLambton College seeks to encourage creativity, innovation and invention among its faculty, students, and staff. The college invests in this endeavour by making available its own facilities, equipment, personnel, and information resources. The college\n        also actively seeks specific support for creative activity from external sources, both public and private. Frequently, inventions, discoveries, and creative works that are developed by individuals at the college will have commercial and / or scientific\n        and scholarly value. The intent of this policy is to provide incentives that foster creative activity, and to help assure that any intellectual property produced through research and innovation activities will be exploited for the benefit of the creators,\n        the college applied research enterprise, and the public. To help meet these policy objectives, the college makes available, through the Office of Research & Innovation, technical and legal assistance in procedures necessary to protect ownership of\n        intellectual property and to aid in its commercial development.\nPurpose of Policy\nThe specific aims of this policy include the following:\nEncourage creativity among the faculty, students and staff;\nIncrease the likelihood that ideas, innovations, inventions, and creative works produced at the college are used to benefit the public;\nProtect the rights of scholars with respect to owning the products of their intellectual endeavours;\nAssure compliance with the provisions of contracts with external sponsors; and provide that, whenever possible intellectual property is introduced for commercial development, the creator(s) and the college share any net profits;\nOutline the process for disclosure of inventions by faculty, students and staff to the college;\nEncourage collaborative applied research projects with external partners and provide guidelines for sharing intellectual property, royalties, licensing agreements etc. with external partners.\nEncourage the commercialization of intellectual property that arises from research and innovation at Lambton College.\nChanges to this Policy\nThe college reserves the right to change this policy from time to time. Proposed changes normally will be developed by the Office of Research and Innovation, in consultation with the appropriate stakeholders. Changes to the college\u2019s IP policy are\n            approved by the Academic Excellence Committee, the College Council, the Academic Students Affairs Committee, and the Board of Governors.\nAdministration of Intellectual Property\nThe Office of Research and Innovation shall be responsible for any matter related to college\u2019s research related intellectual property and shall have the sole authority to negotiate the college's rights under these policies.\nWho is Covered?\nThis policy covers college personnel including faculty, administrators, office and technical staff, students, visiting scholars, external partners and all others whose research work affiliation is with the college, whether compensated by the college\n            or not.\nWhat is Covered?\nAll intellectual property produced through a research activity at the college by college personnel, and / or which arises from joint initiatives with outside parties, such as industry or sector partners, are covered by this policy.\nWhat is Intellectual Property?\nIntellectual property (IP) is any form of knowledge or expression created by one's intellect that can be legally protected. In this policy, IP is the product of the act of research, such as: inventions; creative works; technical information;\n                        prototypes; drawings; specifications; know-how, software (including source code and object code); industrial designs. Individuals and/or institutions can own IP in the same way they can own physical property. An owner of IP can control\n                        and receive payment for its use. IP may be registered (see below), through an appropriate national registry office, affording it a certain level of protection for a period of time (varies by the kind of IP). IP may be licensed (giving\n                        someone conditional permission to use the item subject to compensation) or assigned (transferring ownership to another person for compensation).\nIP Protection\nThere are six main types of IP protection under Canadian law: copyrights, industrial designs, integrated circuit topographies, patents, trademarks and trade secrets.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 5270, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "894e6019-e1a9-4c82-a48e-1564ec052831": {"__data__": {"id_": "894e6019-e1a9-4c82-a48e-1564ec052831", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/nfs/nfs_dsw_phx2_prod/debajyotidasgupta6/chatbot/data/2000-3-4-intellectual-property-for-research-activities.txt", "file_name": "2000-3-4-intellectual-property-for-research-activities.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 23927, "creation_date": "2024-08-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-01"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "3563f105-3c6b-4919-a55d-831f04e98780", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/nfs/nfs_dsw_phx2_prod/debajyotidasgupta6/chatbot/data/2000-3-4-intellectual-property-for-research-activities.txt", "file_name": "2000-3-4-intellectual-property-for-research-activities.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 23927, "creation_date": "2024-08-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-01"}, "hash": "d93058692e1ac9e41b0cc5148fdba5b44978603d34926b1a0e99c03e2e074805", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "06e44bc2-356b-49bb-839c-b025e366f6f8", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/nfs/nfs_dsw_phx2_prod/debajyotidasgupta6/chatbot/data/2000-3-4-intellectual-property-for-research-activities.txt", "file_name": "2000-3-4-intellectual-property-for-research-activities.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 23927, "creation_date": "2024-08-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-01"}, "hash": "9eefb7b0c6b68588aa0a6c82d8cd7b6ae9aaf2f67952bd899ff196c38453c00f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "0dcc146d-fc1f-4a85-b29d-c724f965d16c", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "66bf6e0990982df800ae291056d7d2af951f0b970a7bc08ee81bca73ea6015a8", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "In this policy, IP is the product of the act of research, such as: inventions; creative works; technical information;\n                        prototypes; drawings; specifications; know-how, software (including source code and object code); industrial designs.

It may be, for example, the shape of\n                    a table or the shape and ornamentation of a spoon. The design must have features that appeal to the eye. To be eligible for registration with the Industrial Design Office, your design must be original.\nIntegrated Circuit Topographies: Integrated circuit topographies are now considered a form of intellectual property. Recognizing the growing impact of integrated circuit technology in virtually all fields of industry, and the need to protect\n                    Canadian innovations in this technology both nationally and internationally, Canada has introduced protection for integrated circuit topographies. Topographies are innovative, three-dimensional circuit designs used in many different products.\n                    Examples of such products are automobiles, industrial robots, cameras, spacecraft and computers.\nPatents: Patents include, without limitation, all inventions, discoveries, know-how (despite the fact that these may not benefit from patent protection) or other material that is patentable under Canadian law, as well as all software that\n                    is excluded from \"copyrightable material\" (whether or not patentable under Canadian law).\nTrademarks: Trademarks include a word, a symbol, a design (or a combination of these features), used to distinguish the wares or services of one person or organization from those of others in the marketplace or any other feature that is considered\n                    a trademark under Canadian law.\nTrade secrets: Trade secrets are ideas or know-how (business methods, processes, machines, formulas, patterns and techniques) that are kept secret from one's business competitors.\nOwnership of the Intellectual Property Generated through Research Activity\nOwnership of IP is and shall be vested with the Institute, or with the Creator(s), depending on the type of IP and the circumstances under which the IP was created.\nCreator(s) (College Staff, Faculty and Admin) shall own IP that is:\nPersonnel who anticipate engaging in off-campus research development, or creative activities related to their area of expertise which are independent of their campus activities, the personnel may claim an ownership interest. If they\n                            are full time faculty or staff, they must communicate the scope of such off-campus endeavours to their Department Head and Dean or analogous supervisors and obtain written approval prior to commencing the endeavours.\nIP that the Institute has specifically agreed to assign to the Creator(s).\nCollege shall own IP that is:\nIntellectual property or creative works developed by College personnel within their field of expertise and scope of employment at the College shall be considered the property of the College.\nThe result of any work specifically commissioned by the Institute of a Lambton College employee, pursuant to a written contract of employment, or when release time from their normal duties has been designated for such work.\nThe result of sponsored work done under the terms of a contract or other agreement between Lambton College and a sponsor/client.

External partner can be Companies, Industries and Not for Profit. The collaborative research projects can be grant based\n                                or contract projects. In the case of contract projects, partner covers the cost of the project. In both cases, the following IP ownership rule will be applied:\nApplied Research Projects will ensure the rights of Lambton College students and employees to describe the research projects in their CVs without disclosing any existing or New IP. They may also make presentations about the project\n                                and publish aspects of the project after prior approval by the respective industrial partner(s) and such approval shall not be unreasonably withheld.\nIt is expected that the general knowledge gained through the applied research projects will be incorporated into teaching materials and will support further research without disclosing any of the industrial partner's IP.\nIP in Collaboration with Indigenous Individuals or Communities: Research conduct and ownership of the intellectual property or creative works developed by indigenous individual or communities in collaboration with Lambton College shall\n                            be determined based on Lambton College Guiding Principles Document: \u201cGuideline for Research in Collaboration with Indigenous People\u201d.\nDisclosure Process\nIP Generated with no external partner\nIntellectual property disclosable hereunder shall be disclosed to the Office of Research & Innovation. IP is disclosed by completing and submitting the Disclosure Form to the Office of Applied Research & Innovation. The form describes\n                        of the details of the invention including:\nNames of all creators and contributors to the creation;\nA description of the creation and the research done to create it, as well as identifying what the creator thinks makes the creation unique;\nA list of all funding sources that were used to complete the research.\nThe Office of Research & Innovation will meet with the creator to review the disclosure. During this meeting the Office of Applied Research and Innovation will gain an understanding of the invention by asking questions to determine what\n                        the creation does, how it works, what it can be used for, what the creator feels is \u201cnovel\u201d about the creation, and what future development of the creation the creator plans to pursue.\nFollowing the preliminary evaluation of the potential IP the creation will be assessed to determine if it is ready to commercialize or whether further research is required before the invention can hold any commercial value.\nIP Generated with external partner\nWhere the college enters into an agreement with an external partner that may result in the generation of intellectual property, the parties will ensure that a written agreement sets out their respective rights to the intellectual property\n                        in the work following section 6.3., and any terms relating to the sharing of risk and revenue from the exploitation of the work.\nThe College researchers must disclose the developed IP to the external partner as the external partner owns the IP (Section 6.3.). The external partner will be responsible for protection and commercialization of the new IP.\nCommercialization\nFor the IP owned by the Creator(s) (formerly 8.1)\nCollege personnel who wish to pursue the commercialization of their \u201cindependently\u201d developed and owned intellectual property (Section 6.1.) will be responsible for the commercialization of their IP.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 8523, "end_char_idx": 13970, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d80c6304-fd4b-4681-96a9-d293b2825ba9": {"__data__": {"id_": "d80c6304-fd4b-4681-96a9-d293b2825ba9", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/nfs/nfs_dsw_phx2_prod/debajyotidasgupta6/chatbot/data/2000-3-4-intellectual-property-for-research-activities.txt", "file_name": "2000-3-4-intellectual-property-for-research-activities.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 23927, "creation_date": "2024-08-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-01"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "3563f105-3c6b-4919-a55d-831f04e98780", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/nfs/nfs_dsw_phx2_prod/debajyotidasgupta6/chatbot/data/2000-3-4-intellectual-property-for-research-activities.txt", "file_name": "2000-3-4-intellectual-property-for-research-activities.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 23927, "creation_date": "2024-08-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-01"}, "hash": "d93058692e1ac9e41b0cc5148fdba5b44978603d34926b1a0e99c03e2e074805", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "0dcc146d-fc1f-4a85-b29d-c724f965d16c", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/nfs/nfs_dsw_phx2_prod/debajyotidasgupta6/chatbot/data/2000-3-4-intellectual-property-for-research-activities.txt", "file_name": "2000-3-4-intellectual-property-for-research-activities.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 23927, "creation_date": "2024-08-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-01"}, "hash": "a13adc4d80e6c18a8db32113d21c36a81d0a61e63bb7a219e4ae1ff481551d54", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "9d91dfe5-e888-4141-bbf9-f84cbf1b5f6b", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "bb5527cb97510f6a74e4e8f0581e049a73f2b2a378690d5b51d9d6ce24df86e7", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "IP Generated with external partner\nWhere the college enters into an agreement with an external partner that may result in the generation of intellectual property, the parties will ensure that a written agreement sets out their respective rights to the intellectual property\n                        in the work following section 6.3., and any terms relating to the sharing of risk and revenue from the exploitation of the work.\nThe College researchers must disclose the developed IP to the external partner as the external partner owns the IP (Section 6.3.).

The Creator is encouraged to inform\n                        the Office of Research & Innovation. The Office of Applied Research & Innovation will assess the commercialization activities, and if appropriate, provide support.\nIf the Creator is willing to transfer the \u201cindependently\u201d developed and owned intellectual property (Section 6.1.) by disclosing the intellectual property to the Office of Applied Research and Innovation, the Office will evaluate the commercial\n                        potential of the intellectual property and make a recommendation to the President. Acceptance of such intellectual property by the college will be made at the sole discretion of the College and will require creator(s) to accept all\n                        provisions of this policy.\nFor the IP Owned by the College (formerly 8.2)\nLambton-owned IP may be protected, developed and/or commercialized in the manner that the Institute deems appropriate, and at the Institute\u2019s expense. Where Lambton College decides not to develop and/or commercialize the IP, it may waive\n                        its ownership rights in favour of the Creator(s); or, if the IP has been assigned to the Institute by the Creator(s), it will be returned to the Creator(s).\nLambton College will give favourable consideration to Creator(s) who wish to undertake commercialization of Lambton-owned IP themselves, provided the Creator(s) make a convincing case that they have an appropriate business plan and the\n                        resources to execute said plan. Requests of this nature will not be unreasonably denied. In cases where the Creator(s) conduct the commercialization themselves the Institute shall be entitled to receive a share in the Income realized\n                        by the Creator(s).\nFor the IP Owned by the External Partner (formerly 8.3)\nThe external partner will be responsible for protection and commercialization of the new IP.\nConflict Resolution\nThe Executive Dean of Applied Research and Innovation is responsible for the administration of this policy. The Office of Research & Innovation will handle questions regarding the application, interpretation or implementation of the policy,\n                        or regarding disagreement among creators concerning assignment of rights or sharing of royalties.\nDisagreement with any determination made by that Office may be directed to the President or his or her designee for a final determination.\nWaiver or Return of Rights\nSince the college aims to encourage creativity, it reserves the right to allow some flexibility in applying this policy on a case-by-case basis. The college may, at its sole discretion, waive, transfer, or license to the creator its rights\n                        to any intellectual property when such action does not conflict with obligations to other interested parties. This could occur for instance, if the costs of protecting and developing the intellectual property are not likely to be matched\n                        by anticipated income. If at any time the college shall terminate its effort to seek protection of intellectual property, or to discontinue commercial development, the inventor shall, upon filing a request with the college and completing\n                        appropriate transfer of rights, be free at his or her expense to seek a patent or copyright, and / or develop, license, and otherwise use the material, subject to the college's rights to reimbursement of incurred costs and sharing\n                        of future royalties, in amounts to be negotiated between the college and the creator on a case-by-case basis.\nUse of Lambton College Name, Mark, or Insignia\nUse of the college name, seal or logo on letterhead and business cards is standardized and regulated by the Communications and Marketing Department.

The\n    support provided through the Fund will build organizational capacity, contribute to the status of the College, and promote employee professional development through the conduct of applied research.\nPolicy\nThe total amount available for the RIF will be established annually as part of the College budget process.\nEligible applicants are:\nfull-time employees of Lambton College;\nassociate faculty members who\nhave a minimum 2 courses of teaching experience at the College, and\nare - at the time of the submission of the proposal - teaching a minimum of one course and will be teaching at least one course during the project, and\nhave two years of experience in carrying out research, preferably in collaborative research projects;\npart-time staff members who\nhave a minimum one year work experience at the College, and\nare - at the time of the submission of the proposal - working a minimum of 20 hours per week and will be working at least the same during the project, and\nhave two years of experience in carrying out research, preferably in collaborative research projects.\nThe maximum individual grant from the Lambton College Research Innovation Fund will be established annually by the Applied Research and Innovation Committee. Grants may be provided for the entire proposal or a portion of it.\nFor full-time faculty, RIF applications, must be submitted three months before the start of the term in which the proposed research project will commence if a release is required.\nResearch funded through the Research Innovation Fund is subject to all applicable federal and provincial regulations and College policies, the College Intellectual Property policy, and Lambton College Research Ethics Board approval.\nProposals will be submitted through the Internal Research Funding Request Process.\nThe proposed research application will be reviewed, recommended, or not, and ranked by the RIF Review Panel and forwarded to the Vice-President, Applied Research & Innovation for consideration and approval. All reviews and considerations will be based on the criteria\n            and priorities established and published annually by the Research & Innovation Department.\nFunding for projects will be granted on the merits of the proposed project.\nPriority will normally be given to applicants who are not currently receiving and have not previously received College funding for research. (Applicants who have previously received funding, will be considered only if they have demonstrated achievement\n            of their approved deliverables.) Priority will normally be given to full-time employees.\nRIF support will be provided to a researcher for only one fund-supported research project at a time.\nThe funding may be used to cover research costs in all forms including, but not limited to, release time, equipment and materials, survey development and data analysis.\nIt is recommended that applied research projects be undertaken in collaboration with a business, industry, community, or educational partner. Collaborative projects will be given priority over non-collaborative projects.\nFor collaborative projects involving an external partner(s), a letter of understanding about responsibilities, deliverables, and intellectual property rights must be signed by the external partner(s) prior to the commencement of any research work\n            under this partnership.\nFor full-time faculty and staff, the proposed research application must be reviewed and approved by the applicant's supervisor before submission. Final approval of an application will be dependent\n            upon the supervisor's statement of support, which must include affirmation of discussion and awareness of the proposed project, and agreement that approval of the project may result in release time for the applicant. This statement of support will not\n            be unreasonably withheld. Release time is to be mutually agreed upon by the researcher, his/her supervisor, and the Research Office administrative staff.\nFor full-time faculty and staff, all approved course- and work-release funds from the Research Innovation Fund will be provided to the employee's department, not directly to the researcher.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 5334, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b821ce61-c245-4cbf-a61e-b4d96809d9be": {"__data__": {"id_": "b821ce61-c245-4cbf-a61e-b4d96809d9be", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/nfs/nfs_dsw_phx2_prod/debajyotidasgupta6/chatbot/data/2000-3-5-research-innovation-fund.txt", "file_name": "2000-3-5-research-innovation-fund.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 6307, "creation_date": "2024-08-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-01"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "ddc36a64-f4b6-4368-bb68-8cfdfcfc177f", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/nfs/nfs_dsw_phx2_prod/debajyotidasgupta6/chatbot/data/2000-3-5-research-innovation-fund.txt", "file_name": "2000-3-5-research-innovation-fund.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 6307, "creation_date": "2024-08-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-01"}, "hash": "8e123371647231afd67d7debaa137db4987e0cc9545c81fe65bd8f71e60d2bc7", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "fa51cf1d-01f3-47ed-acb0-5467f757ad7c", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/nfs/nfs_dsw_phx2_prod/debajyotidasgupta6/chatbot/data/2000-3-5-research-innovation-fund.txt", "file_name": "2000-3-5-research-innovation-fund.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 6307, "creation_date": "2024-08-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-01"}, "hash": "7265d83c4a31977732c4211fc596c23b9c6a8c34184c87cf64ba8dba93205348", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "For collaborative projects involving an external partner(s), a letter of understanding about responsibilities, deliverables, and intellectual property rights must be signed by the external partner(s) prior to the commencement of any research work\n            under this partnership.\nFor full-time faculty and staff, the proposed research application must be reviewed and approved by the applicant's supervisor before submission.

college will provide a copy of this policy in an alternate format.\nThis policy draws substantially on the\nGuidance on Authorship in Scholarly or Scientific Publications\n, Office of the Provost, Yale University.\nThe public's trust in and benefit from academic research and scholarship relies upon all those persons involved in the scholarly endeavour adhering to the highest ethical standards, including standards related to the publication and dissemination of findings\n    and conclusions.\nPolicy\nAll scholarly or scientific publications involving faculty, staff, students or trainees arising from academic activities performed with the support or oversight of Lambton College must include appropriate attribution of authorship and disclosure of\n        relevant affiliations of those involved in the work, as described below.\nPublications, which, for the purposes of this policy, include articles, abstracts, manuscripts submitted for publication, presentations at professional meetings or other venues, and applications for funding, must appropriately acknowledge contributions\n        of colleagues and partners involved in the design, conduct or dissemination of the work by neither overly attributing contribution nor ignoring meaningful contributions.\nFinancial and other supporting relationships of those individuals or bodies involved in the scholarly work must be transparent and disclosed in publications arising from the work.\nAuthorship Standards\nAuthorship of a scientific or scholarly paper should be limited to those individuals who have contributed in a meaningful and substantive way to its intellectual content. All authors are responsible for fairly evaluating their roles in the project\n        as well as the roles of their co-authors to ensure that authorship is attributed according to these standards in all publications for which they will be listed as an author.\nScholarly or Scientific Publications for Collaborative Projects with Industry and Organizations\nIf a project is conducted in collaboration with any external organization and industry (the partner), any publication, presentation and knowledge dissemination must follow the individual agreement between the Partner(s) and the College. This agreement\n        can be an Intellectual Property (IP) Agreement, Master Collaboration Agreement, Schedule D, or any similar agreements.\nBased on the College's current Intellectual Property policy, IP rights are expected to be allocated to industrial Partners for commercialization, with support from the project and Lambton College.\nLambton College Researchers and Students may make presentations about a project and publish aspects of a project only after receiving prior written approval by the respective Partner(s). The Partner must receive any presentation, publication, press\n        release or any other outreach or knowledge dissemination activity materials in order to make a decision, provide suggestions and grant approval.\nIf the presentation or publication concerning a collaborative project is approved, individuals from the Partner who meet the criteria for authorship must be included as authors.\nIndustry or corporate representatives or others retained by the industry or corporation who contribute to a publication and meet the requirements for authorship or acknowledgement must be appropriately listed as contributors or authors on the article\n        and their industry and/or corporate affiliation must be disclosed in the publication.\nRequirement for Attribution of Authorship\nEach author must have participated sufficiently in the work to take public responsibility for its content. All co-authors should have been directly involved in all three of the following:\nPlanning and contribution to some component (conception, design, conduct, analysis or interpretation) of the work that led to the paper or interpreting at least a portion of the results;\nWriting a draft of the article or revising it for intellectual content; and\nFinal approval of the version to be published. All authors must review and approve the manuscript before it is submitted for publication, at least as it pertains to their roles in the project.\nLead Author\nThe lead author is usually the person who has performed the central experiments of the project. Often, this individual is also the person who has prepared the first draft of the manuscript. The lead author will usually serve as the \"corresponding\n        author\".\nThe lead author is ultimately responsible for\nensuring that all other authors meet the requirements for authorship,\nensuring the integrity of the work itself.\nCo-Author(s)\nEach co-author is responsible for considering his or her role in the project and whether that role merits attribution of authorship.

For example, heading a laboratory, research program, section or department\n        where the research takes place does not, by itself, warrant co-authorship of a scholarly paper or a publication. Nor should \"gift\" co-authorship be conferred on those whose only contributions have been to provide general support to the project.\nAlthough not qualifying as co-authors, individuals who assist the research effort may warrant appropriate acknowledgement in the completed paper.\nAuthorship Disputes\nDeterminations of authorship roles are often delicate and potentially controversial. To avoid confusion and conflict, discussion of attribution should be initiated early in the development of any collaborative publication. For disputes that cannot\n        be resolved amicably, individuals may seek the guidance of the Applied Research and Innovation Department and in particular the Executive Dean, the Research Development and Outreach Manager or the Research Operations Manager.\nDisclosure of Research Funding and Other Support\nIn all scientific and scholarly publications and all manuscripts submitted for publication, authors must acknowledge the sources of support for all activities leading to and facilitating the preparation of the publication or manuscript, including,\n        but not limited to:\nGrant, contract and gift support;\nTechnical or other support if substantive and meaningful to the completion of the project.\nFor questions or concerns regarding this policy, please contact the\nPolicy Sponsor\nby phoning our main line 519-542-7751.\nSearch", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 4487, "end_char_idx": 7829, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b04d58c3-18be-4e92-9240-501479b7662c": {"__data__": {"id_": "b04d58c3-18be-4e92-9240-501479b7662c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/nfs/nfs_dsw_phx2_prod/debajyotidasgupta6/chatbot/data/2000-3-9-research-data-security.txt", "file_name": "2000-3-9-research-data-security.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 15852, "creation_date": "2024-08-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-01"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "599b42b3-827e-4c11-b357-f9287a821190", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/nfs/nfs_dsw_phx2_prod/debajyotidasgupta6/chatbot/data/2000-3-9-research-data-security.txt", "file_name": "2000-3-9-research-data-security.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 15852, "creation_date": "2024-08-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-01"}, "hash": "7f3be24ca25d5de7b0de8f22d1db47d199576fc3c35b3cfc34dac15c5e765cca", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "182dc1d0-e025-4a53-b5b7-602b5f192fb4", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "00b87d818de5eff3f56ff1f3482f7190c8ef44cd2c462e61f926703803c23127", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "All Policies\n1000 Index, Circulation Lists, Amendments\n2000 Academic & Student Affairs\n3000 Personnel Administration\n4000 General Administration\n2000-3-9 Research Data Security\nResponsible Executive\nVice-President, Research & Innovation\nPolicy Sponsor\nVice-President, Research & Innovation\nIssue Date\nMay 30, 2019\nLast Review\nApril 7, 2021\nLast Revision\nMay 30, 2019\nUpon request, the college will provide a copy of this policy in an alternate format.\nResearch and scholarly activities that gather or generate data concurrently create risk for the researchers, research partner and the College. Risk arises in the probability or threat of damage, injury, liability, loss, or any other negative occurrence\n    that flows from external or internal vulnerabilities inherent in the gathering, generation and storage of data, and that may be avoided or mitigated through preemptive action. This policy will guide researchers to the appropriate and expected risk-mitigated\n    collection and storage of data arising from research conducted under the auspices of Lambton College, and confirmation of the acceptability of the data management plan with any research partners.\nPolicy\nThis policy applies to all scholars undertaking research (and hereafter included in the term researchers) and researchers who are undertaking data-generating research and who are employees of, or contractors with, Lambton College, or are otherwise\n            affiliated with Lambton College through their scholarly or research activity,or who are undertaking scholarly or research activities under the auspices of, or in any manner of association with, Lambton College.\nResearchers shall assess privacy risks and threats to the security of data, inclusive of \u201cinformation\u201d pertaining to the research and individuals included in the research, for all stages of the research life cycle and implement appropriate measures\n            to protect information and ensure data security. Safeguarding data respects the privacy of participants and partners\u2019 protected Intellectual Property (IP) and helps researchers fulfill their confidentiality obligations.\nIn adopting and implementing measures to safeguard data and information, researchers must follow disciplinary standards and practices for the collection and protection of information and data gathered for research purposes, as a minimum.\nFurther, researchers must undertake data-security risk assessments and implement data security measures that are fully consistent with the requirements of this policy and its appendix.\nData and Information Sources\nResearch project data and information typically arise from two sources, which by their nature determine the need for data protection.\nDeveloped intellectual property (IP) data through research projects - The policy of the College with respect to IP is to give all the project IPs to the partner,making it critical to protect the project data.\nData arising from surveys, interviews and other activities for participants in research - Research projects, particularly social science and humanity projects, collect data from research participants.

limits established and documented on the use, disclosure and retention of the information and data.\nMinimizing risks to participants, including risks of re-identification of individuals, must be clearly identified as the highest priority in the design and implementation of the data gathering and data storage.\nAny recordings of observations (e.g., photographs, videos, sound recordings) in the research that may allow identification of particular participants must be well and fully protected\nAppropriate security safeguards over the full life-cycle of data and information must be documented

data about participants, whether those data are contained\n                            in public or personal records, must be considered and anticipated,and appropriate and sufficient data-security measures implemented to prevent or eliminate these possible uses.\nData Storage\nThe researcher must identify and implement data storage protocols that are consistent with the identified level of risk and the guidance provided in the appendix.\nThe data storage protocols will identify and directly address the various types of storage devices that will be used and the protocols associated with each of the types of devices.\nThe device protocols must be consistent with the guidance provided in the appendix.\nData Retention\nData retention periods will be influenced or determined by funding agency requirements.\nIn the case that a project is not externally funded, the College will conform with any agreements made with the research partner. In those cases in which the partner has no requirement or preference,a five-year retention standard will be recommended.\nThe College will destroy all research data after a five-year period, unless there is in place an agreement with a partner or funder specific to a particular body of data indicating some other storage period that has been approved by the Dean responsible\n            for applied research.\nAppendix A: Guidance for the Determination of Research Data-Security Level of Risk\nRisk within Research and Scholarly Activities\nRisk is a probability or threat of damage, injury, liability, loss or other negative occurrence that results from external or internal vulnerabilities, and that may be avoided through pre-emptive action.\nWith respect to research and scholarly activities, a project will have various risks by the nature of the research project. Some pertinent variables include:\nWhat is the research question?\nWhat are the characteristics of the participants? Are they people in vulnerable circumstances, of diminished capacity, with less power than the researcher?\nWhat research methods are proposed?\nHow sensitive are the data that will be collected? What could be the consequences of a data security breach?\nHow will the research data be stored?\nDetermination and Confirmation of Risk\nAn important early task in any research project is to identify data-security risks and determine the level of risk in the project.The steps below must be taken to determine and confirm the level of the data-security risk in a project. The table below\n        should be used as a guide in determining the data-security risk level. Whenever it is not clear which of two levels of risk is the more appropriate,the researcher shall identify the higher level of risk.\nThe initial determination of risk level falls to the primary researcher on the project. The researcher is considered the research and subject expert and should have the best knowledge of and insight into the subject matter and research project.\nFor projects that require Research Ethics Board (REB)approval, the REB will make the final determination of the level of risk involved after consideration of the recommendation of the primary researcher.\nWhen the project does not require REB approval, the Dean responsible for applied research, or designate,should be consulted by the researcher if there is any question or lack of clarity concerning the level of risk.\nUltimately,for projects not requiring REB approval,the Dean responsible for applied research must confirm the data-security level of risk for the project before any research begins.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 4454, "end_char_idx": 9876, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "73b5c731-b285-4587-acf9-854c7fa8d36c": {"__data__": {"id_": "73b5c731-b285-4587-acf9-854c7fa8d36c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/nfs/nfs_dsw_phx2_prod/debajyotidasgupta6/chatbot/data/2000-3-9-research-data-security.txt", "file_name": "2000-3-9-research-data-security.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 15852, "creation_date": "2024-08-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-01"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "599b42b3-827e-4c11-b357-f9287a821190", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/nfs/nfs_dsw_phx2_prod/debajyotidasgupta6/chatbot/data/2000-3-9-research-data-security.txt", "file_name": "2000-3-9-research-data-security.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 15852, "creation_date": "2024-08-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-01"}, "hash": "7f3be24ca25d5de7b0de8f22d1db47d199576fc3c35b3cfc34dac15c5e765cca", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "182dc1d0-e025-4a53-b5b7-602b5f192fb4", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/nfs/nfs_dsw_phx2_prod/debajyotidasgupta6/chatbot/data/2000-3-9-research-data-security.txt", "file_name": "2000-3-9-research-data-security.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 15852, "creation_date": "2024-08-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-01"}, "hash": "5e001abfc67f5b618b8fd6862208dbed61040a32cd638c5c9bb897c6345567aa", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "aa30d96e-358a-4b30-82f5-389e85761f1a", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "a996d0af8c74dea23e46d5444ad2a47975ee154e15227295e16ce46976fb95a8", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "The table below\n        should be used as a guide in determining the data-security risk level.

The consultant must be an individual or firm capable of investigating the matter and having the\n            knowledge and background to do so. After the conclusion of the consultation, the Dean will confirm the level of risk.\nLevels of Risk for Data Security and Associated Requirements\nThe table below provides for each possible level of risk for data security a definition and example and the commensurate minimum storage and IT requirements.\nThis table provides guidance to the researcher in establishing the level of risk associated with the research data and identifies the associated required storage and IT requirements.\nLevels of Risk for Data Security and Associated Requirements\nRisk Level\nDefinition\nStorage Requirements\nIT Requirements\nNo Risk\nThe project has no identifiable risk associated with the research data. The data may be non-descriptive general data or the product of research not related to a company, human or animal. e.g. gathered through standard open access method.\nExample: Initial literature review of a well-known subject with no IP consequences and no human involvement.\nSimple storage in a responsible manner is sufficient i.e. data are not negligently or carelessly mishandled.\nThe data are handled and stored in a responsible manner, with no specific handling or storage techniques or protocols required.\nNon-encrypted desktop or laptop drive\nNon-encrypted USB drive\nCloud Storage (OneDrive, Microsoft Teams)\nLow Risk\nData that contains, or could contain, sensitive information. However,there are no identifiers in the data set to link the participants to the collected data.\nExample: The data gathered from an anonymous survey where no identifiers were collected.\nPhysical documents must be kept in a locked office or storage room with a general lock on it.\nDigital storage is on a computer that is password protected.\nProper data backup protocol is followed with emphasis on security.\nFor low risk data storage, a flash drive or cloud service is acceptable as long as the data are accounted for at all times.\nNon-encrypted desktop or laptop drive\nNon-encrypted USB drive\nCloud Storage (OneDrive, Microsoft Teams)\nMedium Risk\nData that bear some risk to the participants or company involved if there were a data security breach. The data may, for example, contain identifying information and technical data that can be linked to the participants. Or,the data may\n                        reveal a company\u2019s technological approach. The data may include company-sensitive information that does not include identifiers.\nExample: Interview transcripts collected by a researcher investigating community perspectives on public transportation where participant identifiers are included.\nPhysical storage will require a locked cabinet within a locked institutional space. Digital data needs to be kept secure as well. The data should not be unnecessarily duplicated or stored on unsecure devices. Unsecure devices can include\n                        flash drives or portable hard drives and cloud storage devices that are not encrypted.\nEncrypted desktop or laptop drive\nEncrypted USB drive\nCloud Storage (OneDrive, Microsoft Teams)\nHigh Risk\nData that carry a significant risk of harm or loss to the participants or company involved if there were a data security breach.\nExample: Video recordings of participants involved in a therapeutic intervention. Or,experimental data that are used for a patent.\nPhysical storage requires a locked cabinet within a locked institutional space. Electronic storage and research data transfer over the Internet require encryption or use of denominalization software to prevent access or interception by\n                        unauthorized individuals, or other risks to data security.

The data should be considered as sensitive as any developed\n        report and carry the same risk as the entire project.\nThe data should be deleted as soon as possible in order not to risk exposure of sensitive information.In every case, the data are to be deleted from the device within 24 hours of collection or transfer to reports.\nIf the device is a shared device,then data must be purged from the device as soon as possible.\nIf the data are deemed high risk, then shared devices cannot be used to record or store data.\nIf the data are to be retained, copies must be made and stored with other research materials and removed from the shared device.\nData Transfer Devices\nData Transfer devices include portable hard drives, flash drives, etc. When sensitive data are used, these devices should be avoided as much as possible as they are not secure unless they are encrypted. If their use is necessary, then these devices must\n        be erased at the earliest possible time and purged of sensitive material. The Lambton College IT Department will provide these devices for use.\nCloud Services\nCloud services inherently carry risk as a storage method and transfer media.

2022\nUpon request, the college will provide a copy of this policy in an alternate format.\nPolicy\nIn addition to various federal and provincial financial assistance programs (such as the Ontario Student Assistance Program) the College makes available financial assistance to qualified students in an effort to equalize educational opportunities for\n    all.\nStudent Emergency Loan Fund (S.E.L.F)\nPurpose of the Fund\nThe Lambton College Student Emergency Loan Fund (S.E.L.F) is intended to provide a short\u2010term means of assistance to students of the College experiencing temporary cash flow problems of a nature directly influencing their attendance and performance at\n        the institution.\nFinancial Support\nThe fund is a stand\u2010alone account held at a lender. Loans from this fund will continue as long as there is money in the account. Although it is interest free, users are required to pay a fee of $10 for each loan that is issued. Revenue from this fee is\n        added to the account.\nEligibility\nAll full\u2010time students in receipt of OSAP funding enrolled in any program may apply to the emergency loan fund. Applicants must provide evidence satisfactory to the Office of the Registrar & Financial Aid Services of their need for the loan and their\n        ability to repay the loan within a 60\u2010day period.\nNon\u2010OSAP and part\u2010time students are not normally eligible to borrow from the College Student\nEmergency Loan Fund. In exceptional circumstances, the Financial Aid Coordinator may approve a request should special circumstances be warranted.\n        Emergency Loan Fund payments cannot be made to applicants who require funds either directly or indirectly for purposes other than meeting expenses that are normally incurred in support of attendance at College.\nLambton College is not able to accept any responsibility to provide loan assistance to its students. Emergency loan funds will be issued to students as long as there are funds in the emergency loan account. Requests are dealt with in the order of their\n        receipt to Financial Aid Services.\nLoan Amounts\nTotal indebtedness to the Emergency Loan Fund on a short\u2010term basis may not exceed $1000 at any one time. A user fee of $10 is charged for each cheque issued to the student.\nTerms\nThe Student\nEmergency Loan Fund is an interest free loan. Repayment is due in full within 60 days of loan issuance.\nProcedure\nThe student is required to complete an Emergency Loan Application and meet with their Enrolment Services Professional to discuss their financial situation. The Enrolment Services Professional will review the application and check the student's financial\n        and academic record to determine if the applicant is in good standing with the College. In the case of an OSAP student, verification of OSAP funding will be done. A non\u2010OSAP student, if deemed eligible for a loan, must provide the Enrolment Services\n        Professional with a repayment plan.\nIf the student is eligible, a cheque is written directly in Financial Aid Services. Two signatures are required to issue a cheque. Signing authority rests with the Financial Aid Coordinator, the Registrar, and the two Associate Registrars. The loan amount,\n        including the $10 user fee, is then recorded on the student's account in the student record system.\nFund Management\nThis fund is managed by the Financial Aid Coordinator who reports to the Associate Registrar. The Financial Aid Coordinator ensures that all emergency loans are entered into the student record system. In addition, the Financial Aid Coordinator keeps updated\n        spreadsheets that are reconciled on a monthly basis and forwarded to Finance. The purpose of the reconciliation is to ensure that the account is not put in overdraft.\nScholarships\nDefinition\nA monetary award issued to students to recognize outstanding academic achievement.\nProcedures\nResponsibility for administering the scholarship program rests with the Financial Aid Consultant. Each year, the Financial Aid Consultant works with the academic schools to select the scholarship recipients based on the eligibility requirements of each\n                scholarship and the previous year\u2019s academic work.\nThe award recipient and the donor are invited to an annual awards ceremony, which takes place in March.\u00a0 This event is planned and orchestrated by the Foundation.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4814, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b1e641d8-9016-4d47-b2f2-d6267ad1d2e4": {"__data__": {"id_": "b1e641d8-9016-4d47-b2f2-d6267ad1d2e4", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/nfs/nfs_dsw_phx2_prod/debajyotidasgupta6/chatbot/data/2000-4-3-students'-financial-aid-(scholarships-bursaries-self).txt", "file_name": "2000-4-3-students'-financial-aid-(scholarships-bursaries-self).txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 6016, "creation_date": "2024-08-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-01"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "e892ca61-c86e-4c0e-b68e-36f3ba449749", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/nfs/nfs_dsw_phx2_prod/debajyotidasgupta6/chatbot/data/2000-4-3-students'-financial-aid-(scholarships-bursaries-self).txt", "file_name": "2000-4-3-students'-financial-aid-(scholarships-bursaries-self).txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 6016, "creation_date": "2024-08-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-01"}, "hash": "3583aad756d983c9d188f8072265b6962b5b3041c79bc0bde4f0872695e2d7e9", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "4abefcf7-8605-42c7-90f3-95e6087eb59a", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/nfs/nfs_dsw_phx2_prod/debajyotidasgupta6/chatbot/data/2000-4-3-students'-financial-aid-(scholarships-bursaries-self).txt", "file_name": "2000-4-3-students'-financial-aid-(scholarships-bursaries-self).txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 6016, "creation_date": "2024-08-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-01"}, "hash": "5e3d6cd64f14446ba721e72cd7ef80175b4c50caa532dccb14a54cfbd2d4788c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Fund Management\nThis fund is managed by the Financial Aid Coordinator who reports to the Associate Registrar.

These rights are subject to limits described in those documents and as prescribed by law\n                        as can be demonstrably justified in a free and democratic society. The extent of a right or a freedom may reasonably vary with the circumstances so that an exercise of a right which may be appropriate in a public place may not be appropriate\n                        in an educational institution.\nStudents have rights, under the Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act of Ontario, to see any records which are made about them and to have records remain secure and private for College purposes only, subject to limitations on\n                        those rights contained in that statute. Records include biographical information, letters and memos, grades, papers, projects, and other work submitted, as well as commentaries made about a student's performance in work-integrated learning\n                        situations and may be stored in a variety of media.\nStudents have the right to an environment that is safe, secure, and free from harassment and/or discrimination in which they can study, play and interact with freedom from:\nAbuse of authority -

Grades, fees, the transcript, etc. will be treated the same as described below under Academic Sanctions for an expulsion.\nDisciplinary decisions and sanctions shall be made part of the student's official record for College administrative purposes.\nThe College reserves the right in all cases, and notwithstanding the immediately following section, on the basis of information and comment provided to it, to undertake and institute interim measures to ensure the safety of the College community or\n                any members of it, or to meet the demonstrated needs of a complainant, for the duration of the investigation when, in its judgment, there is a need to do so. For example, a respondent may be moved from a complainant's residence, restricted from\n                entering certain parts of campus and/or restricted from attending class. The College will also take steps to minimize the impact of interim measures on respondents. While interim measures are not, nor intended to be, disciplinary, non-compliance\n                will be considered a violation of the student code of conduct. The College may impose interim measures immediately, without a hearing. Respondents may ask the College to review a decision to impose interim measures, but only to address the impact\n                of the imposed measure and the preference for other alternatives.\nSuspension of a Student by the Senior Vice-President, Academic & Student Success\nIn certain circumstances, the Senior Vice-President, Academic & Student Success, or the President, may impose an indefinite suspension or expulsion prior to a hearing. Such suspensions may include the issue of a written trespass warning notice, in\n                accordance with s.2 of the Ontario Trespass to Property Act.\nSuch a suspension will be imposed:\nTo ensure the safety and well-being of members of the College community or preservation of College property; or\nTo ensure the student's own physical or emotional safety and well-being; or\nIf the student presents a definite threat of disruption or interference with the normal operations of the College\nDuring this suspension, the student shall be denied access to College premises, services and participation in College activities for which the student might otherwise be eligible.\nWritten trespass warning notices shall be communicated immediately by the Registrar to the Senior Vice-President, Strategy and Corporate Services, the Director of Facilities and affected employees and students.\nAcademic Dishonesty\nAdherence to acceptable standards of academic honesty and integrity is an important aspect of the learning process. The evaluation of the student's performance is built on the premise that the work submitted by the student is in fact the work of the\n                student, unless designated otherwise, and completed under the terms and conditions that are either set down by the professor or the College, or are generally understood within the College.\nAcademic dishonesty strikes at the heart of an educational institution and will not be tolerated.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 15663, "end_char_idx": 20704, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "bf17d21b-fad1-43c6-8e85-81a2ece1422f": {"__data__": {"id_": "bf17d21b-fad1-43c6-8e85-81a2ece1422f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/nfs/nfs_dsw_phx2_prod/debajyotidasgupta6/chatbot/data/2000-5-1-student-rights-responsibilities-discipline.txt", "file_name": "2000-5-1-student-rights-responsibilities-discipline.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 39004, "creation_date": "2024-08-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-01"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "fb664b7a-59f2-496d-9262-36743b507e7d", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/nfs/nfs_dsw_phx2_prod/debajyotidasgupta6/chatbot/data/2000-5-1-student-rights-responsibilities-discipline.txt", "file_name": "2000-5-1-student-rights-responsibilities-discipline.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 39004, "creation_date": "2024-08-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-01"}, "hash": "d2a746b046411eee13df7f4f27425589470135ed6d56f1b6c34647d6b966f0ef", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "4e3f0449-7f83-4ce5-ae50-4638459ae657", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/nfs/nfs_dsw_phx2_prod/debajyotidasgupta6/chatbot/data/2000-5-1-student-rights-responsibilities-discipline.txt", "file_name": "2000-5-1-student-rights-responsibilities-discipline.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 39004, "creation_date": "2024-08-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-01"}, "hash": "58d21a0bcb117e1652774c07ad05585cd8ff855f544a320993f168944e087458", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "5351b203-d8ee-4229-9d2c-d1b52fcabd3a", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "aee71d32bb73c7e09c48f191f6c739e236b6fd2a8ae58ffa9578356efdf9c9cf", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Written trespass warning notices shall be communicated immediately by the Registrar to the Senior Vice-President, Strategy and Corporate Services, the Director of Facilities and affected employees and students.\nAcademic Dishonesty\nAdherence to acceptable standards of academic honesty and integrity is an important aspect of the learning process.

At the request of the student, the timeline may be extended by an additional five working days.\nFollowing the hearing, the Dean or delegate will add to the student record a summary of the offense, the rationale for the disciplinary decision, and the rationale for the sanction and add it to the Student Record. If the sanction results in a grade\n                of zero on the assignment or lower, then the Dean or delegate will apply the sanction.\nIf the sanction results in the failure of a course or a more serious outcome, the Dean will inform the Registrar, in writing, of the findings from the hearing and their decision. The Registrar will apply the sanction to the student's record and notify\n                the respondent.\nRequest for Reconsideration of Discipline Decisions\nIf the respondent or complainant disagrees with the interim measures, disciplinary decision or sanction arising from misconduct or academic dishonesty, a request for reconsideration can be made. Such requests by the respondent will not be heard in\n                those cases in which a minor sanction has been imposed.\nThe request for reconsideration is available where at least on of the following conditions/grounds is met:\nThere is new information that, through no fault of the respondent, was unavailable at the time of the hearing and is likely to change the outcome;\nThere is evidence of procedural error or bias in the process;\nThe sanction imposed is grossly disproportionate to the nature of the offense.\nIf the decision was made by a delegate (e.g. the Hearing Office in the case of a minor Academic Integrity complaint) the respondent must request an informal review prior to proceeding to a formal request for reconsideration. The respondent must submit\n                a request for review, in writing, to the Dean (for Academic Integrity matters) or Registrar (for non-academic disciplinary matters), who will review the evidence, the decision and the sanction. The Dean or Registrar will meet with the student\n                and determine whether to uphold the original decision and the sanction.

Such high-risk students often have behavioural or mental health problems that may require responses from\n        the College and its service providers. With a coordinated and collaborative approach that identifies the high-risk student, and provides the appropriate institutional response and specific services and supports for the student, the College will be\n        able to address effectively and efficiently the needs of these students and the College.\nThis policy establishes the framework and mechanisms, by which the College will identify the high risk student, organize and implement an appropriate institutional response, and monitor the effectiveness of the response and the behaviour of the student.\nThis policy augments, but does not supersede, the\nStudent Rights & Responsibilities & Discipline (2000-5-1)\npolicy.\nPolicy\nAll employees within Lambton College are expected to identify a student who exhibits threatening or disruptive behaviour.\nThe employee should report the threatening or disruptive behaviour to the Registrar, if the behaviour or incident occurs outside the classroom or instructional setting, or to the student's program Dean if the behaviour or incident occurs within an\n            instructional setting, per the Student Rights and Responsibilities and Discipline Policy section 2.1.2. If the report is incorrectly directed, the receiving Dean or Registrar will forward the report to the correct administrator.\nThe Registrar or Dean who ultimately receives the report has responsibility for the incident file (\"responsible administrator\") and will determine if the student behaviour should be addressed through the Discipline Policy and, if so, will proceed\n            accordingly. Whether or not the Discipline Policy is applied, the responsible administrator will record the incident and any actions taken in the Student Record file (STRK) on the Student Information System (SIS).\nThe responsible administrator will consider the seriousness of the behaviour with respect to the presence of, or potential for imminent or future violence. If the behaviour involves violence, the threat of violence, or potential for imminent or future\n            violence, then the responsible administrator must contact the Associate Vice-President, Student Success in order to consider the establishment and involvement of an Intervention Team.\nThe formation of an Intervention Team may be initiated by the Associate Vice-President, Student Success when he becomes aware that a significant number of incidents, or an incident or incidents of significant seriousness, have occurred with a student.\nIn order to ensure the awareness of the Associate Vice-President, all administrators responsible for dealing with student behaviour matters will record all significant incidents and any subsequent actions taken in the student records in the College\n            information system.\nIn instances in which the Associate Vice-President, Dean or Registrar is concerned with current, threatened or imminent violence, the administrator may so advise the Senior Vice-President, Academic (SVP, A) who may choose, per the\nStudent Rights & Responsibilities & Discipline (2000-5-1)\npolicy, to suspend immediately the student. Such action will lead to the formation of an Intervention\n            Team.\nThe High-Risk Student Intervention Team, hereafter known as the \"Intervention Team\", will be a cross-functional team comprised of service and administrative representatives from some or all of Counselling, Disability Services, Health Services, the\n            Registrar, student's program Dean and the Associate Vice-President, Student Success. The\u00a0Associate Vice-President, Student Success will act as team lead. The Intervention Team may enlist additional support persons and resources if required (e.g\n            psychologist, police).\nThe Intervention Team will determine a High-Risk Student Intervention Plan. The Intervention Plan will address the concerns or threats raised by the student, and the needs of the student and the College, through a collaborative College response. The\n            Intervention Plan will consist of some or all of the following components:\nan assessment of the situation,\na plan of action,\na determination of how the plan will be communicated,\na determination of how the plan will be monitored,\nthe assignment of a College contact for the student and,\nthe assignment of emergency services specifically tailored to meet the needs of the student, if necessary.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 5164, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6833f704-6b70-409a-a3c3-44f479b27a82": {"__data__": {"id_": "6833f704-6b70-409a-a3c3-44f479b27a82", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/nfs/nfs_dsw_phx2_prod/debajyotidasgupta6/chatbot/data/2000-5-2-assessing-addressing-serving-the-high-risk-student.txt", "file_name": "2000-5-2-assessing-addressing-serving-the-high-risk-student.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 41964, "creation_date": "2024-08-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-01"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "2b6bdd8f-f449-43e0-8cc6-31d3ece00f25", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/nfs/nfs_dsw_phx2_prod/debajyotidasgupta6/chatbot/data/2000-5-2-assessing-addressing-serving-the-high-risk-student.txt", "file_name": "2000-5-2-assessing-addressing-serving-the-high-risk-student.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 41964, "creation_date": "2024-08-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-01"}, "hash": "457979375bf4bb14dc00054e6bc6388d60a6d1001f217670a95dde0d37b3cbc4", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "3ccfe778-af40-4952-a973-9d47a941e16b", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/nfs/nfs_dsw_phx2_prod/debajyotidasgupta6/chatbot/data/2000-5-2-assessing-addressing-serving-the-high-risk-student.txt", "file_name": "2000-5-2-assessing-addressing-serving-the-high-risk-student.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 41964, "creation_date": "2024-08-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-01"}, "hash": "b0f3641460cf774e753fd8d1202d0308c9f4b79046e7e018da0d48c53e68bd70", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "6c4c5d12-4920-49a6-b90e-de27ddf4ebf6", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "ac53c29eb9f9e821ca07e99b58dd84a8d3239396faf489d7a94bcd9338352fab", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "The\u00a0Associate Vice-President, Student Success will act as team lead.

The student's signature is not required for the Intervention Plan to be put into effect. The student's refusal to sign the plan should be documented, and the student will be advised of the\n            consequences of not signing.\nThe student and the Primary Student Contact will review the Intervention Plan. The student will be made aware that information will be shared with those service providers and interveners identified within the plan.\nPlan Distribution\nThe\u00a0Associate Vice-President, Student Success will distribute in a confidential manner the Intervention Plan to service providers and interveners as identified in the plan. Potential recipients include service areas, such as Health Services, Disability\n            Services and Counselling, Director of Plant/Security, academic administration and others as required.\nOnce distributed, the Intervention Plan is to be treated as confidential. Copying for further distribution is prohibited.\nPlan Storage\nThe Intervention Plan will be maintained in the central student file (STRK), which can be accessed by any authorized staff who may have interaction with the student.\nA copy of the Intervention Plan will be capped in the student's file in that area from which the Primary Student Contact is monitoring the intervention plan. (e.g Counselling, Disability Services or Health Services)\nPlan Revision\nThe Intervention Plan will be reviewed by the Primary Student Contact in conjunction with the Intervention Team every semester that the student is in attendance, or as needed.\nChanges in the student's circumstance or service needs may be reflected in a revised Intervention Plan.\nOnce reviewed, the Intervention Plan will be dated and signed by the Primary Student Contact to indicate that the Plan is accurate and relevant and contains current information related to the student's circumstance and service needs.\nThe revised Intervention Plan will be discussed with and signed by the student and distributed to the recipients of the original plan and any additional service providers or interveners added in the plan revision.\nThe original Intervention Plan will be stored in accordance with the College's record retention policies for service and academic areas.\nAnnual Report\nAnnually, the\u00a0Associate Vice-President, Student Success will report to the Senior Vice-President Academic on the number of students for whom an intervention is in place, or has been in place during the preceding year. The report should also describe\n            the amount of time and resources that are being directed to the threatening students and the implementation and success of the plans.\nThreat Assessment Team\nIn any case in which there appears to be significant potential for violence and in all cases involving threats or use of weapons, the Intervention Team will be expanded to become a Threat Assessment Team (TAT). This Team will include the addition\n            of a College executive member or delegate, and any or all of the following as required: professional experts (e.g. psychologist or counsellor trained in risk assessment, social worker, and medical professional), police, and others as identified\n            by the Intervention Team. In the case of immediate threats of violence or violent acts, the police will be called.\nThe Threat Assessment Team will work from the assumption that serious violence is an evolutionary process. Escalating patterns of violence and threat levels will be assigned to the Threat Assessment Team. The Team will consider such items as personality\n            of the student, family dynamics, school dynamics and social dynamics.\nThe Threat Assessment Team should be guided by the questions presented in Threat Assessment in Schools: A Guide to Managing Threatening Situations and to Creating Safe School Climates. The questions are listed in\nAppendix C\n.\nEffective Student Management\nProcedures\nPrevention\nPreventive interventions should be incorporated by faculty and, wherever feasible, by staff or administrators during initial involvement with students. Appropriate student behaviour and the\nStudent Rights & Responsibilities & Discipline (2000-5-1)\npolicy should be incorporated into initial class meetings, orientation (First Day)and in-service\n            sessions for students.\nThe instructor should include standards of appropriate classroom/online behaviour in the course outline or syllabus or as an appendix (referencing college and department guidelines/regulations) to the course outline and discuss them at the first class\n            meeting.\nMost disruptive situations will be handled informally between the faculty member, staff or an appropriate administrator and the student. In some cases, the Associate Dean/Dean or an intervener, such as a counsellor, may be invited to participate.\nClass I Behaviour\nSituational behaviours indicative of emotional stress but NOT disruptive to others.\nObservable behaviours may include:\nanxiety, anger, inability to concentrate, seeking assurance or support, spaced-out look, appearing to be under the influence of a chemical substance, monopolizes instructor's time in class\n                    or online, depression (see below).", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 9369, "end_char_idx": 14720, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "fd0fbf71-6a69-4021-b6c6-b96644e37ac9": {"__data__": {"id_": "fd0fbf71-6a69-4021-b6c6-b96644e37ac9", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/nfs/nfs_dsw_phx2_prod/debajyotidasgupta6/chatbot/data/2000-5-2-assessing-addressing-serving-the-high-risk-student.txt", "file_name": "2000-5-2-assessing-addressing-serving-the-high-risk-student.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 41964, "creation_date": "2024-08-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-01"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "2b6bdd8f-f449-43e0-8cc6-31d3ece00f25", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/nfs/nfs_dsw_phx2_prod/debajyotidasgupta6/chatbot/data/2000-5-2-assessing-addressing-serving-the-high-risk-student.txt", "file_name": "2000-5-2-assessing-addressing-serving-the-high-risk-student.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 41964, "creation_date": "2024-08-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-01"}, "hash": "457979375bf4bb14dc00054e6bc6388d60a6d1001f217670a95dde0d37b3cbc4", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "6c4c5d12-4920-49a6-b90e-de27ddf4ebf6", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/nfs/nfs_dsw_phx2_prod/debajyotidasgupta6/chatbot/data/2000-5-2-assessing-addressing-serving-the-high-risk-student.txt", "file_name": "2000-5-2-assessing-addressing-serving-the-high-risk-student.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 41964, "creation_date": "2024-08-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-01"}, "hash": "1c48f1c6e58ab925c0d696e12b77cea4327932377aa3b45d4f2887537466ca04", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "18114a33-c884-44ed-8ef4-016f34cb2407", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "dfc718fa8d151d83b8edc20690e29e49585cce457d833b4c080c43f1c4b1e254", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "The instructor should include standards of appropriate classroom/online behaviour in the course outline or syllabus or as an appendix (referencing college and department guidelines/regulations) to the course outline and discuss them at the first class\n            meeting.\nMost disruptive situations will be handled informally between the faculty member, staff or an appropriate administrator and the student.

She failed the last test. She is in class today with\n                            a cut and bruise on her face.\nDepression:\nDepression can be expressed in many ways. It may be indicated by: sleeping during class, feelings of helplessness and /or hopelessness, weight gain or loss, a change in sleep patterns, feelings of worthlessness,\n                    low self-esteem, and lack of energy.\nExample:\nA student appears to sleep in the back of the classroom. When awake, he responds to questions first, never raising his hand or allowing others to voice an opinion.\nSuggested Action:\nIf the student does not follow the standards of behaviour, or the instructor has cause for concern, the instructor gives feedback to the student through verbal or written comments in a timely manner. The instructor\n                    speaks with the student privately and confidentially and registers the concern. It is crucial to document all exchanges involving discussions of student behaviour. Guidelines for documentation are found in\nAppendix A\n.\nReferral:\nThe instructor informs the student of available assistance on campus. The instructor documents behaviours, completes Incident Report Form (\nAppendix B\n) and forwards to counseling coordinator and program Dean . The Dean will enter incident in STRK.\nCaution:\nIf a student expresses any suicidal statement or makes any suicidal gesture, follow procedures for Class III.\nClass II Behaviour\nBehaviours causing disruption in or outside of classroom.\nDescription of Potential Behaviours:\nObservable behaviour may include: irrational, inappropriate, unrelated or bizarre verbal or written comments, verbal abuse, defiance, anger, inappropriate focusing of attention on self\n                    in class, inappropriate physical contact.\nExample 1:\nA student storms into the classroom after instruction has started. He starts to bellow and rage about a parking ticket he has received, interrupting, and halting the classroom activity. The instructor states,\n                            \u201cMr. _________, your behaviour at this time is unacceptable. Please stop immediately and take your seat.\u201d\nExample 2:\nA student has written work which describes the acting out of a behaviour which is violent in nature directed at an inanimate object. Another student notices and questions the written material. The author\n                            becomes verbally aggressive towards the other student. The instructor states, \u201cMs ____________, your comments and tone are unwelcome in my class, please stop now.\nSuggested Actions:\nIf appropriate, talk with the student privately and confidentially after class or in a scheduled conference. Express concern. The instructor clearly defines limits for acceptable behaviour in a timely manner.\n                    This may be done through verbal or written comments.\nReiterate clearly defined limits for acceptable behaviour. Maintain confidentiality.\nExample 3:\nA student is lying on the floor of the library, talking to himself. Staff approaches the student and quietly states: \u201cMr. ________, others cannot concentrate because of the distraction you are creating.\n                            Please take your seat now. If there is a problem, I can call someone to speak with you.\u201d\nExample 4 (the angry student from example 49(a)(i)):\nThe student continues to rant about the parking ticket, the college, the instructor, 'the way things are run around here,' etc. The instructor states, \u201cMr. _______,\n                            you have been asked to take your seat and have not done so. Please leave the classroom immediately.\u201d\nIt is crucial to document all exchanges involving discussions of student behaviour.

In the event of a removal\n                    from class, the appropriate academic administrator must be notified.\nDisciplinary Procedures:\nFor a serious infringement or, if the student continues the disruptive and/or inappropriate behaviour, the instructor should follow each step in the order listed below:\nThe instructor notifies the Dean or Registrar filling out the appropriate documentation Incident Report form (\nAppendix B\n).\nThe Dean or Registrar and the instructor meet to review the situation and create an\naction plan\nto solve the problem (a counsellor may be asked to advise in development of the action plan). Action plans should include a conference\n                    (with the Dean, instructor and student), and possibly a behavioural agreement for the student. Copies of the action plan, documentation describing the incident(s), the date for the initial conference and names of those attending, (and\n                    behavioural agreement, if used) should be placed on STRK by Dean. The Dean will inform the Registrar and Associate Vice-President, Student Success.\nThe student is notified of the action plan and a date for an initial conference is set in a timely fashion. A key contact person is established for the follow up conferences.\nIf indicated, a meeting date within 10 working days with the key contact person and the student to review the student's progress should be scheduled.\nIf, after the initial conference, the matter is considered sufficiently serious, it may be referred to the Intervention Team and notification to the Senior Vice-President, Academic & Student Success. At the first review meeting with the instructor,\n                    student and key contact person (after first 10- working day review period), if behaviour is deemed acceptable, no further follow-up is required. Student will be informed that their behaviour will continue to be monitored. Results of the\n                    review meeting will be documented forwarded to the Dean and submitted to STRK.\nIf behavioural improvement is marginal, follow-up in another 10 working days is required; with the understanding this will be the last opportunity to work on behavioural change. Results of the review meeting will be documented. Copies will\n                    be forwarded to the Academic Dean and placed on STRK.\nAt the second review meeting with the instructor, student and key contact person (after second 10-[working] day review period), if behaviour is deemed acceptable no further follow-up is indicated. Results of the review meeting will be documented\n                    and submitted to STRK.\nIf behaviour has not met requirements of the behavioural agreement, the matter is referred to the Intervention Team, Registrar and Academic Dean with copies of all documentation for final action to be taken. The Senior Vice-President, Academics\n                    & Student Success is notified.\nIf behaviour has not met requirements in behavioural agreement, the matter is referred to the Dean with copies of all documentation for final action to be taken. The Academic Dean will take appropriate measures as per the Colleges Students\n                    Rights and Responsibilities policy and will notify the Registrar of appropriate action. If the matter is forwarded to the academic Dean or Registrar, the Academic Dean or Registrar will meet with the student.\nThe possible outcomes are:\nThe situation is resolved informally. Results of the review meeting will be documented and placed on STRK. Copies will be forwarded to the Registrar and the Academic Dean.\nThe situation warrants further action.

To this end, Lambton College includes a co-operative education or internship component in those programs in which the work experience will contribute to\n    student development and success.\nPolicy\nThe College will provide a work-integrated learning (WIL) component in every program of study in which the experience will meaningfully contribute to student development, learning and success in achieving the program learning outcomes.\nThe WIL component may vary by program in its nature, extent, format, structure and requirements for success. The WIL component in each program will be optimized for student learning and success, and efficient and effective program operation.\nWithin any degree program with a WIL component, the WIL component and learning experience will:\nbe appropriate to the field of study,\nhave articulated and appropriate learning outcomes that contribute to the attainment of the program learning outcomes,\nbe supervised by both a College representative with relevant academic credentials and an employer/agency member, who will collaborate in guiding and evaluating the student\u2019s performance,\nprovide an opportunity and structure for a required, submitted student reflection on the WIL experience relative to the program learning outcomes. At a minimum, this component will include a student evaluation of the WIL experience, to be\n                    submitted to the program coordinator or faculty member assigned to the course.\nIn a degree program, the WIL experience will amount to no less than 14 weeks of full-time equivalent work (420 hours) in one or multiple blocks, as appropriate to achieving the program learning outcomes.\nIn programs that must meet or seek to meet external or professional requirements, the WIL component will be guided in structure and duration by those requirements.\nWIL co-op and internship experiences will typically be paid experiences. Clinical and field placements are typically not paid experiences.\nThe WIL component in a program will use one of four models and be guided by the relevant following section of this policy. The four models are:\nCo-operative education (Co-op)\nInternship\nClinical Placement\nField Placement\nCo-operative Education and Internships\nA co-operative education (co-op) program formally integrates work experience in an employment setting into a student\u2019s academic studies. A co-op program begins with an academic term; work and academic terms are then scheduled in a pre-determined sequence.\nA mandatory co-op program requires the successful completion of the co-op component or identified WIL alternative in order for the student to graduate from the program.\nAn optional co-op program provides the opportunity for the student to engage in a co-op experience, but does not require completion of the co-op component for graduation from the program.\nAn internship program formally integrates work experience in an employment setting with a student\u2019s academic studies. An internship program begins with an academic term; academic terms and the work experiences then occur concurrently in a pre-determined\n            sequence.\nIn order for a program to be recognized by the College as a co-op or internship program and for the student\u2019s work experience to be recognized for College credit, the following requirements must be met.\nThe student\u2019s work experience position is approved, as a suitable learning position, by the program-relevant co-op advisor in the Co-op & Career Services department.\nDuring the work experience, the student is actively engaged in productive work that actively engages the student.\nThe student\u2019s experience on the job is monitored by the College. See Co-Operative Education and Internship Procedures.\nThe student\u2019s performance on the job is supervised and evaluated by the employer.\nThe student\u2019s grade for the work experience course is determined by the Co-op & Career Services co-op advisor with consideration of the employer\u2019s evaluation and feedback. In degree programs, the student\u2019s grade for the co-op or internship\n                    experience is assigned by a program faculty member with relevant academic credentials and with consideration of the employer\u2019s evaluation and feedback.\nA co-op work term must consist of a minimum of 12 weeks and 420 hours of work.\nAn internship work experience runs concurrently with an academic term, and must consist of a minimum of 160 hours of work over the length of the academic term.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 5111, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1e4e4db5-d967-4d3e-863b-352ebc997c08": {"__data__": {"id_": "1e4e4db5-d967-4d3e-863b-352ebc997c08", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/nfs/nfs_dsw_phx2_prod/debajyotidasgupta6/chatbot/data/2000-8-1-work-integrated-learning.txt", "file_name": "2000-8-1-work-integrated-learning.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 14160, "creation_date": "2024-08-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-01"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "b6592310-013c-43c5-8f65-f9011e3c76b4", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/nfs/nfs_dsw_phx2_prod/debajyotidasgupta6/chatbot/data/2000-8-1-work-integrated-learning.txt", "file_name": "2000-8-1-work-integrated-learning.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 14160, "creation_date": "2024-08-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-01"}, "hash": "1ae6a3c41934a03c740a77e0268e48b555ac41242efc80e3a59a9322f5d09338", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "350025a1-1d47-4622-949f-bd5922bd500b", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/nfs/nfs_dsw_phx2_prod/debajyotidasgupta6/chatbot/data/2000-8-1-work-integrated-learning.txt", "file_name": "2000-8-1-work-integrated-learning.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 14160, "creation_date": "2024-08-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-01"}, "hash": "a7df87e113e83659ab9e29ea12ee9ebe2bd59e8ed10b368ec7039c3fe24d1ac6", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "0c4d5920-9686-4f90-932f-17b7bd6aafe7", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "468af21185a7d3dc3f0728d4710906ca61247173b5141395d19c3ed8978ac251", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "During the work experience, the student is actively engaged in productive work that actively engages the student.\nThe student\u2019s experience on the job is monitored by the College.

Any exception must be approved by the Department Manager, after\n                    consultation with the relevant Dean. The preparation of the student for the co-op/internship experience, the likelihood of the student\u2019s success in the co-op/internship experience, and the safety of the student in the co-op/internship\n                    experience cannot be compromised by any exception granted.\nA student considering or entering into a co-op and internship experience must be aware of and comply with the Co-operative Education & Internship Procedures.\nIt is the responsibility of the student to meet any employment requirements, such as, but not limited to, a visa, work permit, immunizations, security background check, medical clearance.\nWhen offered a position by a potential employer, the student must accept or decline the offer promptly (within one business day of the offer). An acceptance, including a verbal acceptance, is considered a binding contract, and must be honoured.\n                    Failure to honour an acceptance will result in a No Pass (NP) grade for the course.\nA student may not withdraw from a co-op or internship course.

This environment can be achieved through the\n    provision of direct assistance to students, encouragement of independence, and the maintenance of an accessible and supportive learning environment.\nThe College recognizes that education is a \"service\" under the Human Rights Code Ontario (Section 1), which states, \"Every person has the right to equal treatment with respect to services, goods and facilities, without discrimination because of\u2026disability.\"\n    In its provision of education, training and services, the College recognizes its duty to provide reasonable academic accommodation to students with disabilities - where the accommodation can be implemented without compromising the academic integrity\n    of the program or course, imposing undue hardship on the College, or jeopardizing health and safety standards.\nThe Accessibility Centre, administration and faculty each have a role to play and responsibilities associated with ensuring that programs at Lambton College are accessible to students with disabilities and, along with the students with disabilities, that\n    students with disabilities are accommodated in order to minimize the impact of the student\u2019s disability, provide the student with equal opportunity for educational success, and assist the student in reaching full potential.\nPolicy\nAll part-time and full-time Lambton College students are within the scope of this policy.\nAll students must demonstrate the required competencies for successful program and course completion. Implementing accommodations for students with disabilities does not guarantee success.\nAdmissions\nPersons with disabilities must meet program eligibility criteria and any program-relevant applicant selection criteria.\nQualified applicants with appropriate supporting disabilities documentation will be provided reasonable accommodation for any activities required by the College to demonstrate that they meet requirements for an offer of admission to a College academic\n            program, course or other academic offering (e.g., by providing extra time to complete a required pre-admission test).\nThe provision of accommodation and services must be based on respect for individual rights and the dignity of the individual, and the shared commitment of the College community to an open, supportive learning environment.\nResponsibilities\nThe provision of accommodation and services for students with disabilities flows from the meeting of responsibilities which are shared among students, faculty, staff, administration and the Accessibility Centre.\nStudent Responsibilities\nStudents are responsible for being aware of the academic and clinical/placement requirements of the program and the challenges inherent in them, and the possible limitations on future employment opportunities arising from job demands or restrictions.\nStudents with temporary or permanent disabilities are encouraged to identify themselves to the Accessibility Centre as soon as possible - by making an appointment with the Accessibility Centre Counsellor - and ideally before program registration,\n            in order to ensure the greatest opportunity for success.\nIt is strongly recommended that all students with disabilities register at the Accessibility Centre, even if the students feel they will not require accommodations, so documentation is in place should they require accommodation and services at a later\n            date.\nStudents with disabilities should check with the program faculty or coordinator regarding course requirements. If students suspect a course may pose difficulty because of their disability, they should explore options before the start of the term.\n            The Accessibility Centre cannot provide for accommodations on a timely basis without adequate preparation time.\nIt is important for students with temporary or permanent disabilities to discuss their needs with the Accessibility Centre staff and learn about the accommodations and services available. Once eligibility for accommodation and services is determined,\n            students should work with the Counsellor to develop a\nConfidential Academic Accommodation Plan\nthat identifies the individual\u2019s needs to the faculty member(s).\nIn order to receive accommodation for a temporary or permanent disability, students are required to provide the Accessibility Centre with sufficient and appropriate\nsupporting documentation\n.\nDocumentation requirements vary according to the specific disability.\nInterim accommodations for disabilities may be available pending receipt of medical documentation.\nNo documentation is forwarded to the College from secondary schools.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 5385, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d503174f-486a-4cdc-b536-5e1a255ac3df": {"__data__": {"id_": "d503174f-486a-4cdc-b536-5e1a255ac3df", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/nfs/nfs_dsw_phx2_prod/debajyotidasgupta6/chatbot/data/2000-9-1-academic-accommodation-of-students-with-disabilities.txt", "file_name": "2000-9-1-academic-accommodation-of-students-with-disabilities.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 19221, "creation_date": "2024-08-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-01"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "cdd56e2a-0df0-4531-963e-a069ffcc36dd", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/nfs/nfs_dsw_phx2_prod/debajyotidasgupta6/chatbot/data/2000-9-1-academic-accommodation-of-students-with-disabilities.txt", "file_name": "2000-9-1-academic-accommodation-of-students-with-disabilities.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 19221, "creation_date": "2024-08-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-01"}, "hash": "32d71d435028cf0fb2d92f92c3be4a4c4d7373a3fbac5b0ed49135a092d1f1c8", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "6fbd1401-90e6-4b98-aabf-cb6ee47d1f2d", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/nfs/nfs_dsw_phx2_prod/debajyotidasgupta6/chatbot/data/2000-9-1-academic-accommodation-of-students-with-disabilities.txt", "file_name": "2000-9-1-academic-accommodation-of-students-with-disabilities.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 19221, "creation_date": "2024-08-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-01"}, "hash": "86cdbf611cb5bcb6bad7a7e124a30ac051ff45308cefa81b9f5085b35941c762", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "d223fff5-2fb8-4f6e-8dfc-3152dcda70d3", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "593f6eb2e118831446f4317a66f5a40ccd2a826e058d172a83790e610790afcc", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Students with disabilities should check with the program faculty or coordinator regarding course requirements.

Further,\n    the Strategic Plan identifies Academic Excellence, Ours Students and Our People as three of the College's priorities. They speak to a provision of personalized service by caring and innovative employees and a shared responsibility by the College and\n    its employees for employee engagement, development and healthy work environment.\nThe College recognizes its accountability to the students, clients and employees of the College. The College has a responsibility to establish and maintain policies and procedures which provide for the most efficient and effective operation of the College\n    while adhering to the strategic priorities and values of the College. This responsibility includes providing for proper, progressive disciplinary action for conduct contrary to the policies and procedures of the College and for unsatisfactory job\n    performance.\nPolicy\nThe College expects all employees to be conscientious and motivated by self-respect and professionalism which dictates they conduct themselves in a professional manner and perform satisfactorily on the job. In those situations where an employee conducts\n        themselves in an unsatisfactory manner, the College has the responsibility to take corrective action.\nEach step in the progressive disciplinary procedure concentrates on correcting the cause of unsatisfactory behaviour or unsatisfactory job performance. The remedial efforts of the College and the degree of discipline imposed will be reasonable and\n        be commensurate with the severity of the issue at hand.\nEach step in the disciplinary procedure serves to increase the awareness that the end result, if unsatisfactory behaviour and/or unsatisfactory job performance continues, is dismissal. The College may select a higher step in the discipline procedure\n        up to and including dismissal depending on the severity of the offense or performance issue.\nThe College's policy and procedure does not in any way prevent the employee from exercising rights covered under the Collective Agreements (Academic and Support Staff) and the Terms and Conditions for Administrative Staff.\nProcedure\nInformal Level\nOn the first minor incident or infraction, a discussion between the employee and the supervisor is required. The supervisor should keep a written record of the events on file. This record should include details of the infraction as well as any pertinent\n        outcome arising from the discussion with the employee. This record is not to be forwarded to Human Resources at this stage.\nWarning Level\nShould a further incident or infraction occur, prompt action must be taken. The supervisor must discuss the matter with the employee as soon as possible. The employee will be invited to have a union steward attend this meeting, as it may result in\n        discipline. Any meeting involving potential discipline will include an opportunity for the employee to express their side of the matter at hand.\nIf the supervisor determines that a formal warning is warranted, then the supervisor must provide a letter describing the incident or infraction and summarizing the subsequent conversation directly to the employee, ideally on the same or next business\n        day after the discussion. A copy of the letter must be forwarded to Human Resources and to the supervisor's immediate supervisor.\nIf the supervisor determines that a written warning is not warranted, then he or she should treat the matter as described in the Informal Level. In the normal course of events, a further incident or infraction of the same nature would be treated under\n        this Warning Level.\nSanction Level\nShould a subsequent incident or infraction similar in nature to that addressed in a written warning occur, the supervisor must again meet with the employee. The employee will be advised to invite a local steward. The supervisor will listen to the\n        employee's explanation before making any decision whether to impose a disciplinary measure, or regarding what measure to impose. The supervisor need not make either of these decisions at this meeting, and is encouraged to consult with their supervisor\n        and/or with Human Resources.\nWhile it is desirable that a disciplinary regimen be progressive, there may be circumstances or factors that cause the supervisor to determine that a warning is the most appropriate course of action. If so, he or she should proceed with a written\n        warning.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 5178, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "89e70ce6-cd95-4f4d-a1f7-b0a9884c502d": {"__data__": {"id_": "89e70ce6-cd95-4f4d-a1f7-b0a9884c502d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/nfs/nfs_dsw_phx2_prod/debajyotidasgupta6/chatbot/data/3000-2-3-employee-discipline.txt", "file_name": "3000-2-3-employee-discipline.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 9782, "creation_date": "2024-08-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-01"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "5f51b19b-6ff4-49d1-9499-02c8a6194c42", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/nfs/nfs_dsw_phx2_prod/debajyotidasgupta6/chatbot/data/3000-2-3-employee-discipline.txt", "file_name": "3000-2-3-employee-discipline.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 9782, "creation_date": "2024-08-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-01"}, "hash": "ce3507e402614aa6dd296f4da8af05ebf0d28b16c35e2329618f5738708b23ec", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "3b56449c-8d7b-4a67-a009-a03b83922f5b", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/nfs/nfs_dsw_phx2_prod/debajyotidasgupta6/chatbot/data/3000-2-3-employee-discipline.txt", "file_name": "3000-2-3-employee-discipline.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 9782, "creation_date": "2024-08-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-01"}, "hash": "1f6537f0f1461bf3801299cbd6087db7a2e718c2bbf6c0d5872782e636cffeb5", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "45beb70c-50b3-4ebc-8378-2f279a1eea5e", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "e9a54815ea73878c7effeca7073b066bbce7c239d7d32636e5f6bf4d46a37068", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "In the normal course of events, a further incident or infraction of the same nature would be treated under\n        this Warning Level.\nSanction Level\nShould a subsequent incident or infraction similar in nature to that addressed in a written warning occur, the supervisor must again meet with the employee.

If so, he or she should proceed with a written\n        warning.\nIf a greater sanction is indicated than would normally be the next step in a progressive discipline model, then the supervisor must consult with their supervisor and Human Resources for guidance. A letter of reprimand or an unpaid suspension are typical\n        examples of disciplinary sanctions. The principles to be followed are that (1) the selected sanction should be proportionate to the severity of the infraction and (2) continuing misconduct should be met with sanctions of increasing severity. There\n        is no one formula that will apply to all cases. The imposition of the sanction is to be communicated directly to the employee, in writing, copied as per the Warning Level. Such written communication should normally remind the employee that continued\n        misconduct will lead to further discipline which could include termination of employment.\nOnce a sanction is imposed, further misconduct is dealt with at the Sanction Level or at the Dismissal Level.\nDismissal Level\nTermination of employment for cause may be the ultimate conclusion of a progressive discipline regimen, the last in a line of progressively severe sanctions. The steps involved are the same as for the Sanction Level, except that there are additional\n        considerations due to the finality of the action. The supervisor must consult with their supervisor and Human Resources for guidance. Termination of employment must have the approval of the President or their delegate.\nAppendix\nExamples of offenses relating to the workplace include, but are not limited to the following.

2019\nUpon request, the college will provide a copy of this policy in an alternate format.\nThe Academic Collective Agreement sets out a Classification Plan for academic employees that permits an employee to gain salary increments (subject to specific limitations) by completing further formal education.\nThis policy describes the requirements for gaining such increments and the process to be followed by a full-time or partial-load academic employee who plans to pursue further formal education and expects a resulting salary step adjustment.\nPolicy\nA full-time or partial-load academic employee may attain additional salary steps by completing approved additional formal education.\nThe additional steps may not cause the employee's annual base salary to exceed the salary maximum described by the Collective Agreement.\nThe additional formal education must be approved by the College, prior to the commencement of the course of study, in order to qualify for additional salary steps.\nThe additional formal education must result in a formal qualification that would \"constitute the norm in institutions of post-secondary education in the Province of Ontario\".\n(Academic Employees Collective Agreement, effective October 1, 2017)\nThe additional formal education credential must be at a higher lever than the employee's current highest credential in order for the employee to qualify for additional salary steps.\nThe additional formal education must be completed through a\nCanadian post-secondary institution recognized by Lambton College, or\na non-Canadian post-secondary institution that is an accredited, recognized post-secondary institution and a program of study that is deemed to be equivalent to a certificate, diploma or degree from an accredited, recognized post-secondary\n                    institution in Ontario as indicated by deemed equivalency by the World Education Services (WES), and accepted by Lambton College.\nA full-time or partial-load academic employee who is pursuing a non-Canadian credential is required to provide evidence of equivalency from World Education Services (WES) at the time of application for approval and, upon completion of the education,\n            the employee completing a non-Canadian credential must provide a World Education Services (WES) official evaluation report confirming the Canadian equivalency of the credential.\nThe academic employee must submit, in writing, a request for approval of further formal education for the purpose of gaining further salary steps prior to enrolling in the program of study.\nThe written request must include an outline of the proposed program of study and its relevance to the individual and the College.\nApproval of the proposed further education for additional salary steps does not constitute or imply approval for Educational Assistance as described in and provided for by the\nProfessional Development (3000-3-2) policy\n.\nAcademic employees wishing to request approval for educational assistance as described in the Professional Development policy must request approval under that policy and as described by it.\nThe approval of further formal education for additional salary steps is independent of, and implies no connection with or approval for, considerations under the Collective Agreement Article 20 - Professional Development Leave, Article 21 - Leave of\n            Absence or Article 23 - Pre-Paid Leave.\nAcademic employees wishing to request consideration under any of the above Collective Agreement articles must request approval under the relevant article as described by it.\nThe approval process for further formal education for additional salary steps requires a request submitted by the academic employee, consideration by the immediate supervisor, review by the Senior Vice-President, Strategy & Corporate Services, approval\n            by the Senior Vice-President, Academic & Student Success, and written notice of approval from the Human Resources department.\nTo initiate the approval process for further formal education for additional salary steps, the academic employee will meet with the immediate supervisor to discuss the proposal and will then submit to the supervisor the completed formal written\n                    request providing all required information and rationales.\nThe immediate supervisor will review and forward the request to the Senior Vice-President, Strategy & Corporate Services (or designate) to determine the appropriate step progression resulting from the proposed further formal education, consistent\n                    with the Classification Plan for Academic Employees in the Academic Collective Agreement and any other relevant articles in the collective agreement.\nThe Senior Vice-President, Strategy & Corporate Services (or designate) will forward the request and the determination of the step progression and any other relevant comments to the Senior Vice-President, Academic & Student Success for consideration\n                    for approval.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 5449, "text_template":

It is essential that all expenses support business objectives and, because expense accounts can become matters of public\n    record, it is essential that expenses should be incurred and claimed in a manner that is publicly defensible and will not harm the reputation of the College as a good manager of its resources. In incurring and reimbursing travel, meals and hospitality\n    expenses, the reasons and rules must be clear, easily understood and available to the College community and the public. By being accountable and transparent in its use of public funds for travel, meal and hospitality expenses, the College will demonstrate\n    good value for money through the prudent and responsible use of those funds. Legitimate, authorized expenses incurred during the course of the business of the College will be reimbursed.\nConsistent with the above principles, this policy establishes the framework for the incursion of travel, meal and hospitality expenses and the reimbursement of such expenses in order to ensure fair and reasonable practices, provide a structure of accountability\n    and oversight for the incursion and reimbursement of expenses, and establish the parameters for the public disclosure of the policy and expenses.\nPolicy\nThis policy shall be consistent with the Management Board of Cabinet Travel, Meal & Hospitality Expenses Directive. Every funding agreement between the College and a ministry or agency of the Government of Ontario is deemed to include the requirements\n        of this directive. Where there is a conflict between the terms of any agreement and this directive, this directive shall prevail; between this policy and any legislation or collective agreement with the College and employees, the latter shall\n        prevail.\nThis policy and its rules governing the incursion and reimbursement of expenses apply to any person employed by or associated with the College making a claim for travel, meal and hospitality expenses, and includes, but is not limited to, Board of\n        Governors, employees, volunteers, appointees, and consultants and contractors engaged by the College.\nTravel\nThis Policy applies whenever travel is required. Travel does not refer to a person's regular commute to work and is not reimbursable. All travel must be approved prior to being undertaken; otherwise, the travel expense will not be eligible for reimbursement.\nThe following chart identifies the level for approvals for travel for everyone covered by this Policy.

These costs include the following items:\nAdministration - includes expenditures for activities to provide administrative support for the delivery of contracts or agreements such as finance, personnel, payroll, and purchasing.\nFacilities and Property - includes expenditures pertaining to the operation and maintenance of the physical plant for the delivery of contracts and agreements.\nEducational Resources - includes expenditures for those activities to provide services to the contract or agreement such as word processing, printing and duplicating, audio visual support, and library services.\nStudent Services - includes expenditures for those activities to assist the client such as registration, counselling, advertising, promotion, testing, and assessment.\nEquipment/Facilities - includes the cost of using College equipment and facilities.\nThe charge for the administrative fee (mark-up) is calculated as a percentage of direct costs. The percentage utilized by the College is 33.33%.

A charitable tax receipt will be issued for donations over $20. No charitable tax receipts will be issued for contributions.\nA gift involving a naming opportunity requires the development of a gift agreement.\nGift-in-Kind Donations\nLambton College's acceptance of gifts-in-kind will adhere to guidelines set by the CRA.\nGifts-in-kind must be accompanied by an independent appraisal that establishes the fair market value of the gift, an invoice, or any other documentation that adequately establishes the purchase price or fair market value of the gift.\nIt is the donor's responsibility to establish the fair market value of the gift and for any costs incurred to do so.\nLambton College will issue a charitable tax receipt for the fair market value of the gift based on an appraisal, invoice, or other appropriate documentation.\nIf there are significant problems in obtaining the information from point 9, the details should be discussed with the Director, Finance prior to accepting the donation if a tax receipt is required.\nGift-in-kind donations require a Gift-in-Kind Form (\nsee Appendix A\n) to be completed and signed prior to the acceptance of the donation.\nGift of a service provided to Lambton College, in accordance with Canada Revenue Agency, is ineligible for a charitable tax receipt and is not normally recorded as a transaction.\nGift of Art and Other Cultural Property\nLambton College will review residual gifts of art and other cultural property (referred to as \"art\"). Conditions attached to their acceptance are as follows:\nThe art reflects the mission, vision, and values of Lambton College.\nAn independent appraisal is conducted at the donor's expense to determine the value of the art.\nLambton College administration approved the location for the art and arranges the security and maintenance for it.\nPrior to acceptance of the art, the Director, Facilities and Director, Finance will review the requirement of the gift agreement or gift deed.\nGift Refusal\nLambton College may refuse a gift for various reasons, including but not limited to the following:\nGift is inconsistent with the mission, vision, and values or goals of Lambton College.\nGift constitutes a non-gift as per CRA guidelines.\nFair market value of the gift cannot be determined.\nGift will result in unwarranted or unmanageable costs.\nGift requires physical and operating resources beyond Lambton College's capacity.\nAccepting gift will result in physical or environmental hazards.\nGift or term of the gift is illegal.\nDue to the terms of the gift, Lambton College will be unable to honour those terms.\nDefinitions\nGift\nA contribution or donation.\nContribution\nA transfer of property that does not meet the definition of a donation.

policy in an alternate format.\nAll members of the Lambton College community have a right to work and study in an environment that is free from any form of\nsexual violence\n.\u00a0 Lambton College will not ignore, condone\n    or tolerate sexual violence in any form. This policy and response protocol reflect the determination of the College to ensure that those individuals who have been affected by sexual violence are believed, supported and appropriately accommodated,\n    while, ensuring a procedural fair process for investigation, adjudication and sanctioning that respects and protects the rights of individuals, holding accountable those who have committed an act of sexual violence.\nPolicy Applicability\nThis policy applies to all members of the College community including employees, board members, students, contractors, suppliers of services, individuals who are directly connected to any College initiatives, volunteers, and visitors.\nPolicy\nSexual violence is unacceptable and will not be tolerated. Lambton College is committed to confronting and preventing sexual violence and creating a safe space for anyone in our college community who has been affected by sexual violence. The College\n            is committed to providing a safe and positive space where members of the college community feel able to work, learn and express themselves in an environment free from sexual violence.\nAll reported incidents of sexual violence will be investigated to the best of the administration\u2019s ability and in a manner that ensures due process. One purpose of this policy is to make individuals feel comfortable about making a report in good faith\n            about sexual violence that they have experienced or witnessed.\nIt is recognized that sexual violence can occur between individuals regardless of sexual orientation, gender, gender identity or relationship status as articulated in the Ontario\nHuman Rights Code\n.\n It is also recognized that individuals who have experienced sexual violence may experience emotional, academic or other difficulties.\nThe College is committed to:\nassisting those who have been affected by sexual violence by providing choices, with detailed information and support, such as provision of and/or referral to counselling and medical care, information about legal options, and appropriate academic\n                    and other accommodation;\nensuring that those who disclose that they have experienced sexual violence are believed, and that their right to dignity and respect is protected throughout the process of disclosure, investigation and institutional response;\neliminating harmful attitudes and behaviours that reinforce that the person who experienced sexual violence is to blame for what happened; this includes protecting the complainant from irrelevant questions such as those relating to past sexual\n                    history or sexual expression;\ntreating with compassion individuals who disclose sexual violence, recognizing that they are the final decision-makers about their own best interests;\nensuring that on-campus (internal) investigation procedures are available for cases of sexual violence, even when the individual chooses not to make a report to the police;\nengaging in appropriate procedures for investigation and adjudication of a complaint that are in accordance with College policies, standards and applicable collective agreements, and ensure fairness and due process;\nensuring coordination and communication among the various departments who are most likely to be involved in the response to sexual violence on campus;\nengaging in public education and prevention activities;\nproviding information to the college community about our sexual violence policy and protocol;\nproviding appropriate education and training to the college community about responding to the disclosure of sexual violence;\ncontributing to the creation of a campus atmosphere in which sexual violence is not tolerated;\nmonitoring and updating our policy and protocol to ensure that they remain effective and in line with other existing policies and best practices.\nReporting and Responding to Sexual Violence\nMembers of the college community should immediately report sexual violence incidents they witness or have knowledge of, or where they have reason to believe that sexual violence has occurred or may occur. Members who have experienced sexual violence\n            are encouraged to come forward to report as soon as they are able to do so.\nPersons in a position of authority, including persons directing the activities of others, shall take immediate action to respond to or to prevent sexual violence.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 5157, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b23ec409-631d-4262-a72a-c5623c0ffcd4": {"__data__": {"id_": "b23ec409-631d-4262-a72a-c5623c0ffcd4", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/nfs/nfs_dsw_phx2_prod/debajyotidasgupta6/chatbot/data/4000-3-9-sexual-assault-sexual-violence-policy-protocol.txt", "file_name": "4000-3-9-sexual-assault-sexual-violence-policy-protocol.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 47414, "creation_date": "2024-08-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-01"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "95a8bd3a-9381-4ed2-860a-bc7576e60e36", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/nfs/nfs_dsw_phx2_prod/debajyotidasgupta6/chatbot/data/4000-3-9-sexual-assault-sexual-violence-policy-protocol.txt", "file_name": "4000-3-9-sexual-assault-sexual-violence-policy-protocol.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 47414, "creation_date": "2024-08-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-01"}, "hash": "8cd5dffd377f8d2f907649a07bd1f8192c4b59034382da48802af8da71fca79f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "89fb994f-76e0-4b04-a228-a71e73effa24", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/nfs/nfs_dsw_phx2_prod/debajyotidasgupta6/chatbot/data/4000-3-9-sexual-assault-sexual-violence-policy-protocol.txt", "file_name": "4000-3-9-sexual-assault-sexual-violence-policy-protocol.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 47414, "creation_date": "2024-08-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-01"}, "hash": "57889c289cc4dee63a33e0ba13c7496c3bb3dc2b99e0412f3a9a863b0090bf34", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "54b0ac11-1717-45d2-865c-4b4bbe069a6f", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "dae3c00f2abcdcc2166a9196d01d89f9b02b5e9f367c8d9f8ec738d08dd333aa", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Reporting and Responding to Sexual Violence\nMembers of the college community should immediately report sexual violence incidents they witness or have knowledge of, or where they have reason to believe that sexual violence has occurred or may occur.

The College may decide how it meets these obligations in different circumstances and will do so with a view of providing a fair process, making a sound decision, and preserving the dignity of survivors. The College\n            has the right to withhold disclosure early on in its process to obtain a person's independent recollection of events.\nSupport and Representation: Complainants and respondents may attend meetings with a single (non-participating) support person. The College considers requests to attend meetings with additional support persons and with legal or other representation\n            on a case-by-case basis, with a view to promoting a fair and expeditious process. The College may still question and expect direct answers from an individual who is represented.\nIf an individual(s) files a complaint or report on sexual violence and in the process of supplying information reveals a breach of College policy (e.g. Student Discipline policy), no action will be taken by the College respecting those breaches. For example, the inappropriate use of alcohol or drugs, or having unauthorized guests within a residence room. Additionally, reporting an incident of sexual violence will not impact the Study Permit status for an international student.\nNotwithstanding, the College reserves the right, in exceptional circumstances, such as\u00a0 especially egregious breaches of policy (e.g. physical violence) or breaches that have caused the College to initiate\n            policy-breach actions prior to the receipt of the complaint or report, to address the reported breaches of policy.\nThe College reserves the right in all cases and notwithstanding the immediately following statement, on the basis of information and comment provided to it, to undertake and institute interim measures to ensure the safety of the College community\n            or any members of it, or to meet the demonstrated needs of the complainant, for the duration of the investigation when, in its judgment, there is a need to do so. \u00a0For example, a respondent may be moved from a complainant's residence, restricted\n            from entering certain parts of campus and/or restricted from attending class. The College will also take steps to minimize the impact of interim measures on respondents. While interim measures are not, nor intended to be, disciplinary, non-compliance\n            may be considered a violation of the student code of conduct. The College may impose interim measures immediately, without a hearing. Respondents may ask the College to review a decision to impose interim measures, but only to address the impact\n            of the imposed measure and the preference for other alternatives.\nRight to Withdraw a Complaint\nA complainant has the right to withdraw a complaint at any stage of the process. However, the College may continue to act on the issue identified in the complaint in order to comply with its obligation under this policy or its legal obligations.\nProtection from Reprisals, Retaliation or Threats\nIt is contrary to this Policy for anyone to retaliate, engage in reprisals, or threaten to retaliate against a complainant or other individual for:\nhaving pursued rights under this Policy or the Ontario Human Rights Code;\nhaving participated or co-operated in an investigation under this Policy or the Ontario Human Rights Code; or\nhaving been associated with someone who has pursued rights under this Policy or the Ontario Human Rights Code.\nThe College takes reasonable steps to protect persons from reprisals, retaliation or threats. This may entail, for example, advising individuals in writing of their duty to refrain from committing a reprisal and sanctioning individuals for a breach of this duty.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 4613, "end_char_idx": 9751, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "54b0ac11-1717-45d2-865c-4b4bbe069a6f": {"__data__": {"id_": "54b0ac11-1717-45d2-865c-4b4bbe069a6f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/nfs/nfs_dsw_phx2_prod/debajyotidasgupta6/chatbot/data/4000-3-9-sexual-assault-sexual-violence-policy-protocol.txt", "file_name": "4000-3-9-sexual-assault-sexual-violence-policy-protocol.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 47414, "creation_date": "2024-08-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-01"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "95a8bd3a-9381-4ed2-860a-bc7576e60e36", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/nfs/nfs_dsw_phx2_prod/debajyotidasgupta6/chatbot/data/4000-3-9-sexual-assault-sexual-violence-policy-protocol.txt", "file_name": "4000-3-9-sexual-assault-sexual-violence-policy-protocol.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 47414, "creation_date": "2024-08-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-01"}, "hash": "8cd5dffd377f8d2f907649a07bd1f8192c4b59034382da48802af8da71fca79f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "b23ec409-631d-4262-a72a-c5623c0ffcd4", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/nfs/nfs_dsw_phx2_prod/debajyotidasgupta6/chatbot/data/4000-3-9-sexual-assault-sexual-violence-policy-protocol.txt", "file_name": "4000-3-9-sexual-assault-sexual-violence-policy-protocol.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 47414, "creation_date": "2024-08-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-01"}, "hash": "35105bd3cb3b0cda3cb53f032d57e0b786346e3d0a87fb1398393a697cea9ae8", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "dda45e51-c64a-4077-b5ee-f5411b314a87", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "5d29c72cb0af9eec6bbdc1edae1d2f5bd649f044f846a3bb051655b51674c182", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "However, the College may continue to act on the issue identified in the complaint in order to comply with its obligation under this policy or its legal obligations.\nProtection from Reprisals, Retaliation or Threats\nIt is contrary to this Policy for anyone to retaliate, engage in reprisals, or threaten to retaliate against a complainant or other individual for:\nhaving pursued rights under this Policy or the Ontario Human Rights Code;\nhaving participated or co-operated in an investigation under this Policy or the Ontario Human Rights Code; or\nhaving been associated with someone who has pursued rights under this Policy or the Ontario Human Rights Code.\nThe College takes reasonable steps to protect persons from reprisals, retaliation or threats. This may entail, for example, advising individuals in writing of their duty to refrain from committing a reprisal and sanctioning individuals for a breach of this duty. The College may also address the potential for reprisals by providing an accommodation appropriate in the circumstances.\nUnsubstantiated or Vexatious Complaints\nIf a person discloses or files a sexual violence complaint that is not supported by evidence gathered during an investigation, the complaint will be dismissed.\nA disclosure or complaint that is found, following investigation, to be frivolous, vexatious or in bad faith or made purposely to annoy, embarrass, or harm the respondent, may result in sanctions or discipline against the complainant.\nConfidentiality\nConfidentiality is particularly important to those individuals who have disclosed sexual violence. The confidentiality of all persons involved in a report of sexual violence must be strictly observed, and the College will exercise care to protect\n            and respect the confidentiality of all persons, including the complainant, respondent and witnesses by restricting routine access to information to individuals with a need for such access and by providing education and training to those who are\n            regularly involved in the administration of reports and complaints.\nNotwithstanding the above statement, confidentiality cannot be assured if an individual is at imminent risk of self-harm; an individual is at imminent risk of harming another; or there are reasonable grounds to believe that others in the College or\n            wider community may be at risk of harm.\nIn such circumstances as described above, the information will only be shared with the services or authorities necessary to prevent harm, including the College Threat Assessment Team. The name of the assaulted individual will not be released to the public\n            by the College.\nWhere the College becomes aware of an allegation of sexual violence by a member of the college community against another member of the college community, the College may have an obligation to take steps to ensure that the matter is dealt with in order\n            to comply with legal obligations or its policies to investigate such allegations. In such cases, certain College administrators may be informed about the reported incident on a \u201cneed-to-know\u201d and confidential basis, but without necessarily disclosing\n            the identities of the persons involved.\nInformation about the number of times supports, services, and accommodations relating to sexual violence are requested and obtained by students will be provided to the Ministry and the Lambton College Board of Governors in accordance with government\n            regulations.

Sexual assault is characterized by a broad range of behaviours that involve the use of force, threats, or control towards a person, which make that person feel uncomfortable, distressed, frightened, or\n            threatened, or that are carried out in circumstances in which the person has not freely agreed or consented, or is incapable of consenting.\nSexual violence\nAny sexual act or act targeting a person's sexuality, gender identity or gender expression, whether the act is physical or psychological in nature, that is committed, threatened, or attempted against a person without the person's consent, and includes\n            sexual assault, sexual harassment, stalking, indecent exposure, voyeurism and sexual exploitation.\nConsent\nThe voluntary and explicit agreement to engage in the sexual activity in question. It is the act of willingly agreeing to engage in specific sexual activity, and requires that a person be able to freely choose between two options: yes or no. For\n                consent, there must be an understandable exchange of affirmative words that indicates a willingness to participate in mutually agreed upon sexual activity. Further:\nSilence or non-communication must never be interpreted as consent and a person in a state of diminished judgment cannot consent.\nA person does not give consent if they are incapable of understanding the risks and consequences of a sexual act or the ability to understand that they can refuse, by virtue of, for example, intoxication, being drugged, being asleep or being\n                    unconscious.\nA person may be unable to give consent if they have a mental disability preventing them from fully understanding the sexual activity.\nA person is incapable of giving consent to a person in a position of trust, power or authority over him/her, such as, a faculty member in a relationship with a student whom they teach, an administrator in a relationship with an individual\n                    who reports to him/her.\nA person who has been threatened or coerced (i.e. is not agreeing voluntarily) to engage in the sexual activity is not consenting to it.\nThe fact that consent was given in the past to a sexual activity or dating relationship does not mean that consent is deemed to exist for all future sexual activity.\nA person can withdraw consent at any time during the course of a sexual activity.\nConsent cannot be given on behalf of another person.\nIt is the responsibility of the initiator of sexual activity to ensure clear and affirmative responses are communicated at all stages of sexual activity.\nIt is also the responsibility of each party to know if the person they are engaging with sexually is a minor.\nThe\nCriminal Code\ndefines \u201cconsent\u201d as follows:\nConsent: The voluntary agreement to engage in the sexual activity in question.

In Canada, children under 12 can never legally consent to sexual acts. Sixteen is the legal age of consent for sexual acts. There are variations on the age of\n            consent for adolescents who are close in age between the ages of 12 and 16. Twelve and 13 year-olds can consent to have sex with other youth who are less than two years older than themselves. Youth who are 14 and 15 years old may consent to sexual\n            involvement that is mutual with a person who is less than 5 years older. Youths 16 and 17 years old may legally consent to sexual acts with someone who is not in a position of trust or authority.\nCoercion\nIn the context of sexual violence, coercion is unreasonable and persistent pressure for sexual activity. Coercion is the use of emotional manipulation, blackmail, threats to family or friends, or the promise of rewards or special treatment, to persuade\n            someone to do something they do not wish to do, such as being sexual or performing particular sexual acts.\nDrug-facilitated sexual assault\nThe use of alcohol and/or drugs (prescription or non-prescription) by a perpetrator to control, overpower or subdue a victim for purposes of sexual assault.\nStalking\nA form of criminal harassment prohibited by the\nCriminal Code\nof Canada. It involves behaviours that occur on more than one occasion and which collectively instil fear in the victim or threaten the victim/target\u2019s\n            safety or mental health. Stalking can also include threats of harm to the target\u2019s friends and/or family. These behaviours include, but are not limited to non-consensual communications (face-to-face, phone, email, social media); threatening or\n            obscene gestures; surveillance; sending unsolicited gifts; \u201ccreeping\u201d via social media/cyber-stalking; and uttering threats.\nSurvivor\nSome who have experienced sexual violence may choose to identify as a survivor. Individuals might be more familiar with the term \"victim\". We use the term \"survivor\" throughout this policy where relevant because some who have experienced sexual assault\n            believe they have overcome the violent experience and do not wish to identify with the victimization. It is the prerogative of the person who has experienced these circumstances to determine how they wish to identify.\nDisclosure\nWhen someone affected by sexual violence tells a member of the College community about an incident of sexual assault or violence that has occurred on or off campus.\nReport\nWhen someone affected by sexual violence, a witness, or a community member that has received a disclosure, reports the incident according to their college's reporting procedures.\nFormal Complaint\nWhen a survivor of sexual violence requests a formal investigation to resolve a complaint of sexual violence.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 17391, "end_char_idx": 21442, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "40fe35b3-f865-467a-921b-98c9c5e3f5b1": {"__data__": {"id_": "40fe35b3-f865-467a-921b-98c9c5e3f5b1", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/nfs/nfs_dsw_phx2_prod/debajyotidasgupta6/chatbot/data/4000-3-9-sexual-assault-sexual-violence-policy-protocol.txt", "file_name": "4000-3-9-sexual-assault-sexual-violence-policy-protocol.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 47414, "creation_date": "2024-08-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-01"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "95a8bd3a-9381-4ed2-860a-bc7576e60e36", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/nfs/nfs_dsw_phx2_prod/debajyotidasgupta6/chatbot/data/4000-3-9-sexual-assault-sexual-violence-policy-protocol.txt", "file_name": "4000-3-9-sexual-assault-sexual-violence-policy-protocol.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 47414, "creation_date": "2024-08-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-01"}, "hash": "8cd5dffd377f8d2f907649a07bd1f8192c4b59034382da48802af8da71fca79f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "e1113e5a-5c98-420d-9804-58e1b1c166ae", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/nfs/nfs_dsw_phx2_prod/debajyotidasgupta6/chatbot/data/4000-3-9-sexual-assault-sexual-violence-policy-protocol.txt", "file_name": "4000-3-9-sexual-assault-sexual-violence-policy-protocol.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 47414, "creation_date": "2024-08-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-01"}, "hash": "eb9ab6d692d6d70f002075bd4e5afe5beae83a5cc11a217ffa408d028869bff4", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "6cdcfc12-5041-4f4e-8a99-190becf46343", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "05cd966b6e06254ac95c0046d8ecfa0c4c68760e5d73705d886f6b6c78ef2582", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Survivor\nSome who have experienced sexual violence may choose to identify as a survivor.

A supportive response involves:\nlistening without judgement and accepting the disclosure as true;\ncommunicating that sexual violence is never the responsibility of the assaulted individual;\nhelping the individual identify and/or access available on- or off-campus services, including emergency medical care and counselling;\nrespecting the individual\u2019s right to choose the services she/he feels are most appropriate and to decide whether to report to the police and/or College nurse;\nrecognizing that disclosing can be traumatic and an individual\u2019s ability to recall the events may be limited;\nrespecting the individual\u2019s choices as to what and how much they disclose about their experience; and\nmaking every effort to respect confidentiality and anonymity.\nIf disclosure is made to a faculty or staff member by a student seeking support or academic accommodation, the faculty or staff member should take the student to the Wellness Centre at Lambton College, and connect him/her with the College nurse\n        and/or counsellors.\nIf an employee of the College becomes aware of an allegation of sexual violence against another member of the College community, the faculty or staff should report the alleged incident to Campus Security (x 3208) immediately.\nCommunicating with Individuals who have Experienced Sexual Violence\nSensitive and timely communication with individuals who have experienced sexual violence and their family members (when an individual consents to this communication) is a central part of the College\u2019s first response to sexual violence. To facilitate\n        communication, the College will:\nEnsure that designated employees in the Wellness Centre who are knowledgeable about sexual violence, are responsible for advocacy on campus on behalf of employees, students or any other member of the College community who has experienced sexual\n            violence;\nEnsure designated employees respond in a prompt, compassionate, and personalized fashion; and\nEnsure that the person who has experienced sexual violence and the respondent is provided with reasonable updates about the status of the College investigation of the incident when such an investigation is undertaken.\nRoles and Responsibilities of the College Community\nWhile everyone on campus has a role to play in responding to incidents of sexual violence, some campus members will have specific responsibilities which might include:\nOn-campus health services to provide psychological and emotional support, assist with safety planning and make referrals to other services, including medical services;\nFaculty, staff and administrators to facilitate academic accommodations and other needs of those who have been affected by sexual violence (e.g. extensions on assignments) continuing studies from home, and dropping courses;\nResidence staff to facilitate safe living arrangements to the best of their abilities;\nStudent-operated sexual violence services to provide peer supports;\nHuman Resources to assist with any incidents relating to employees; and\nSecurity to assist with investigations and gathering evidence, implement measures to reduce sexual violence on campus and to collaborate with local police where appropriate.\nInformation about these resources is available below.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 23862, "end_char_idx": 29181, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "01c58747-ad9d-4c1c-b03a-e05876e18d93": {"__data__": {"id_": "01c58747-ad9d-4c1c-b03a-e05876e18d93", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/nfs/nfs_dsw_phx2_prod/debajyotidasgupta6/chatbot/data/4000-3-9-sexual-assault-sexual-violence-policy-protocol.txt", "file_name": "4000-3-9-sexual-assault-sexual-violence-policy-protocol.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 47414, "creation_date": "2024-08-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-01"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "95a8bd3a-9381-4ed2-860a-bc7576e60e36", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/nfs/nfs_dsw_phx2_prod/debajyotidasgupta6/chatbot/data/4000-3-9-sexual-assault-sexual-violence-policy-protocol.txt", "file_name": "4000-3-9-sexual-assault-sexual-violence-policy-protocol.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 47414, "creation_date": "2024-08-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-01"}, "hash": "8cd5dffd377f8d2f907649a07bd1f8192c4b59034382da48802af8da71fca79f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "6cdcfc12-5041-4f4e-8a99-190becf46343", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/nfs/nfs_dsw_phx2_prod/debajyotidasgupta6/chatbot/data/4000-3-9-sexual-assault-sexual-violence-policy-protocol.txt", "file_name": "4000-3-9-sexual-assault-sexual-violence-policy-protocol.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 47414, "creation_date": "2024-08-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-01"}, "hash": "962bbb92044a918017cdf26fe445e69171bcf57987dcb77686c10884a8244970", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "db5298d2-aa50-4265-829f-63200f448700", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "d2fdfce72df9cbd84aebc8e908a47b19b9977eb3fb6c2c5f0bdaf45b0ca62c2f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Roles and Responsibilities of the College Community\nWhile everyone on campus has a role to play in responding to incidents of sexual violence, some campus members will have specific responsibilities which might include:\nOn-campus health services to provide psychological and emotional support, assist with safety planning and make referrals to other services, including medical services;\nFaculty, staff and administrators to facilitate academic accommodations and other needs of those who have been affected by sexual violence (e.g. extensions on assignments) continuing studies from home, and dropping courses;\nResidence staff to facilitate safe living arrangements to the best of their abilities;\nStudent-operated sexual violence services to provide peer supports;\nHuman Resources to assist with any incidents relating to employees;

The College understands that individuals who have experienced sexual\n            violence may wish to control whether and how their experience will be dealt with by the police and/or the College.\u00a0 In most circumstances, the person will retain this control. A person who has experienced sexual violence may choose not to\n            request an investigation and has the right not to participate in any investigation that may occur.\nIn certain circumstances, however, the College may be required to initiate an internal investigation and/or inform the police of the need for a criminal investigation, even without the person\u2019s consent, if the College believes that the safety\n            of other members of the College community is at risk. The confidentiality and anonymity of the person(s) affected will be a high priority in these circumstances.\nA report of sexual violence may also be referred to the police, or other community resources at the complainant\u2019s request, where the persons involved are not members of the College community or in circumstances where the College is unable to initiate\n            an internal investigation under this policy.\nThe College adheres to the following in investigating and making decisions about formal complaints. If an entitlement set out below conflicts with something set out in another College policy, the entitlement set out below shall prevail.\nIn all three of the cases outlined in sections 7.1, 7.2 and 7.3, the Wellness Centre is responsible for intake. While overall responsibility for investigation and adjudication is outlined below, the College may also decide to use an external investigator\n            where appropriate in the circumstances.\nWhere the Respondent is a Student (formerly 7.1)\nSexual violence is a violation of 2000-5-1 Student Rights and Responsibilities and Discipline Policy. It is considered a serious offence and will be addressed in a manner that is consistent with other serious offences, up to and including\n                            expulsion. See the\nStudent Rights & Responsibilities & Discipline (2000-5-1) policy\nfor\n                            more details on each disciplinary process, including possible penalties. Under this policy, the Registrar is responsible for investigation and adjudication. Appeals of student violations may be pursued on limited grounds and are heard\n                            by the Associate Vice-President, Student Success.\nWhere the Respondent is an Employee (formerly 7.2)\nSexual violence is a violation of the\nRespectful College Community (4000-5-3) policy\n. Allegations against employees will be addressed consistent\n                            with this Policy, any other relevant College policy and the collective agreement, where applicable. If the complaint is sustained following an investigation, the College will determine the appropriate disciplinary actions consistent with\n                            relevant policies and the collective agreement, where applicable, up to and including discharge. Under this policy, when a potential violation by one or more employees is alleged, People & Organizational Development will conduct an investigation\n                            and make decisions. There is no formal appeal process for employee violations, though college employees who are members of a union may file a grievance as permitted by the applicable collective agreement.\nWhere the Respondent is not a Student or Employee (formerly 7.3)\nContractors, suppliers, volunteers or visitors who attend on campus will be subject to complaints if they engage in prohibited conduct. Where a complaint against the respondent is substantiated, the College will take appropriate action, including\n                            penalties, cancellation of contracts, and other sanctions. There is no formal appeal process for supplier, volunteer or visitor violations.\nAll contractual relationships entered into by the College will be governed by a standard contract compliance clause stating that contractors must comply with this Policy and the Ontario\nHuman Rights Code\n, including\n                            co-operating in investigations.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 28115, "end_char_idx": 33592, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "db5298d2-aa50-4265-829f-63200f448700": {"__data__": {"id_": "db5298d2-aa50-4265-829f-63200f448700", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/nfs/nfs_dsw_phx2_prod/debajyotidasgupta6/chatbot/data/4000-3-9-sexual-assault-sexual-violence-policy-protocol.txt", "file_name": "4000-3-9-sexual-assault-sexual-violence-policy-protocol.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 47414, "creation_date": "2024-08-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-01"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "95a8bd3a-9381-4ed2-860a-bc7576e60e36", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/nfs/nfs_dsw_phx2_prod/debajyotidasgupta6/chatbot/data/4000-3-9-sexual-assault-sexual-violence-policy-protocol.txt", "file_name": "4000-3-9-sexual-assault-sexual-violence-policy-protocol.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 47414, "creation_date": "2024-08-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-01"}, "hash": "8cd5dffd377f8d2f907649a07bd1f8192c4b59034382da48802af8da71fca79f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "01c58747-ad9d-4c1c-b03a-e05876e18d93", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/nfs/nfs_dsw_phx2_prod/debajyotidasgupta6/chatbot/data/4000-3-9-sexual-assault-sexual-violence-policy-protocol.txt", "file_name": "4000-3-9-sexual-assault-sexual-violence-policy-protocol.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 47414, "creation_date": "2024-08-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-01"}, "hash": "82a528fb03bc45a7ad8108154f463e19fa5bc4fdf79063796354d261b1f0c570", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "5ff4c0e2-55ef-4559-888d-195447ce3464", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "e206f9ce21bc2974d92cc02a09610c13ad2a41e72cc8aa4ffbb01cd190629d82", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Under this policy, when a potential violation by one or more employees is alleged, People & Organizational Development will conduct an investigation\n                            and make decisions.

The term was replaced many years\n        ago to acknowledge that sexual violence is not about sex but is about acts of psychological and physical violence. The term \u201csexual assault\u201d provides a much broader definition and criminalizes unwanted behaviour such as touching and kissing as well\n        as unwanted oral sex and vaginal and anal intercourse. Although the term no longer has a legal meaning in Canada, the term rape is still commonly used.\nDispelling the Myths and Misconceptions About Sexual Assault\nMyth\nFact\nIt wasn\u2019t rape, so it wasn\u2019t sexual violence.\nSexual assault and sexual violence encompasses a broad range of unwanted sexual activity. Any unwanted sexual contact is considered to be sexual violence. A survivor can be severely affected by all forms of sexual violence, including\n                            unwanted fondling, rubbing, kissing, or other sexual acts. Many forms of sexual violence involve no physical contact, such as stalking or distributing intimate visual recordings. All of these acts are serious and can be damaging.\nSexual assault can\u2019t happen to me or anyone I know.\nSexual assault can and does happen to anyone. People of all socioeconomic and ethnic backgrounds may be sexually assaulted, but the vast majority of sexual assaults happen to women and girls. Young women, Aboriginal women and women\n                            with disabilities are at greater risk of experiencing sexual assault.\nSexual assault is most often committed by strangers.\nSomeone known to the person, including acquaintances, dating partners, and common-law or married partners, commit approximately 75 per cent of sexual assaults.\nSexual assault is most likely to happen outside in dark, dangerous places.\nThe majority of sexual assaults happen in private spaces like a residence or private home.\nIf an individual doesn\u2019t report to the police, it wasn\u2019t sexual assault.\nJust because an individual doesn\u2019t report the assault doesn\u2019t mean it didn\u2019t happen. Fewer than one in ten individuals report the crime to the police.\nIt\u2019s not a big deal to have sex with someone while he/she is drunk, stoned or passed out.\nIf a person is unconscious or incapable of consenting due to the use of alcohol or drugs, they cannot legally give consent. Without consent, it is sexual assault.\nIf the person chose to drink or use drugs, then it isn\u2019t considered sexual assault.\nThis is a prominent misconception about sexual assault. No one can consent while drunk or incapacitated.\nIf the individual didn\u2019t scream or fight back, it probably wasn\u2019t sexual assault.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 32455, "end_char_idx": 37433, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5ff4c0e2-55ef-4559-888d-195447ce3464": {"__data__": {"id_": "5ff4c0e2-55ef-4559-888d-195447ce3464", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/nfs/nfs_dsw_phx2_prod/debajyotidasgupta6/chatbot/data/4000-3-9-sexual-assault-sexual-violence-policy-protocol.txt", "file_name": "4000-3-9-sexual-assault-sexual-violence-policy-protocol.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 47414, "creation_date": "2024-08-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-01"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "95a8bd3a-9381-4ed2-860a-bc7576e60e36", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/nfs/nfs_dsw_phx2_prod/debajyotidasgupta6/chatbot/data/4000-3-9-sexual-assault-sexual-violence-policy-protocol.txt", "file_name": "4000-3-9-sexual-assault-sexual-violence-policy-protocol.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 47414, "creation_date": "2024-08-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-01"}, "hash": "8cd5dffd377f8d2f907649a07bd1f8192c4b59034382da48802af8da71fca79f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "db5298d2-aa50-4265-829f-63200f448700", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/nfs/nfs_dsw_phx2_prod/debajyotidasgupta6/chatbot/data/4000-3-9-sexual-assault-sexual-violence-policy-protocol.txt", "file_name": "4000-3-9-sexual-assault-sexual-violence-policy-protocol.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 47414, "creation_date": "2024-08-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-01"}, "hash": "d6bb1d0aa01eb7ce6946a9bd4330d8877a0c49511d74c1f815a6817b553d5d11", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "f4344d5b-aa8d-46fe-93d3-2bb8644f7313", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "0f753a46a33ac321bccb3d35c00d950765176d1c6eeece310ac75bd148275d72", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Sexual assault is most likely to happen outside in dark, dangerous places.\nThe majority of sexual assaults happen in private spaces like a residence or private home.\nIf an individual doesn\u2019t report to the police, it wasn\u2019t sexual assault.\nJust because an individual doesn\u2019t report the assault doesn\u2019t mean it didn\u2019t happen.

The person may be fearful that if they struggle, the perpetrator will become more violent.\nIf you didn\u2019t say no, it must be your fault.\nPeople who commit sexual assault/abuse are trying to gain power and control over the assaulted individual. They want to make it extremely difficult, if not impossible, for the individual to say no. A person does not need to actually\n                            say the word \u201cno\u201d to make it clear that they did not want to participate. The focus in consent is on hearing a \u201cyes\u201d.\nIf an individual isn\u2019t crying or visibly upset, it probably wasn\u2019t a serious sexual assault.\nEvery individual responds to the trauma of sexual assault differently. They may cry or they may be calm. They may be silent or very angry. Their behaviour is not an indicator of their experience. It is important not to judge a person\n                            by how he or she responds to the assault.\nIf someone does not have obvious physical injuries, like cuts or bruises, they probably were not sexually assaulted.\nLack of physical injury does not mean that a person wasn\u2019t sexually assaulted. An offender may use threats, weapons, or other coercive actions that do not leave physical marks. The person may have been unconscious or been otherwise\n                            incapacitated.\nIf it really happened, the person would be able to easily recount all the facts in the proper order.\nShock, fear, embarrassment and distress can all impair memory. Many people attempt to minimize or forget the details of the assault as a way of coping with trauma. Memory loss is common when alcohol and/or drugs are involved.\nIndividuals lie and make up stories about being sexually assaulted; and most reports of sexual assault turn out to be false.\nAccording to Statistics Canada, fewer than one in 10 sexually assaulted persons report the crime to the police. Approximately 2% of sexual assault reports are false.\nThe number of false reports for sexual assault is very low. Sexual assault carries such a stigma that many people prefer not to report.\nPersons with disabilities don\u2019t get sexually assaulted.\nIndividuals with disabilities are at a high risk of experiencing sexual violence or assault. Those who live with activity limitations are over two times more likely to be sexually assaulted than those who are able-bodied.\nA spouse or significant other cannot sexually assault their partner.\nSexual assault can occur in a married or other intimate partner relationship. The truth is, sexual assault occurs ANY TIME there is not consent for sexual activity of any kind. Being in a relationship does not exclude the possibility\n                            of, or justify, sexual assault. A person has the right to say \u201cno\u201d at ANY point.\nPeople who are sexually assaulted \u201cask for it\u201d by their provocative behaviour or dress.\nThis statement couldn\u2019t be more hurtful or wrong.

College space refers to all property owned or leased by the College.\nPolicy Statements\nUse of Space\nCollege space may be booked by members of the College Community (College staff, faculty, or students), hereafter referred to as Internal, for College associated activities or events.\nAs a publicly funded institution, external organizations, groups, and community users, hereafter referred to as External, may also book College facilities.\nAll utilization of College space must align with the College\u2019s Mission, Vision & Values and must not jeopardize the health or safety of any member of the College community.\nThe College\u2019s academic and other operational activities have priority in the assignment of College space and general bookings should not interfere with academic delivery or other College operations.\nThe College food service provider has first right of refusal for all food and beverage services for all functions on College premises.\nAll use of space booking requests are subject to the provisions of the College's\nFree Speech (4000-5-1) policy\n.\nAny relevant health and safety considerations associated with the specific activities associated with the intended Use of Facility request, are to be identified and addressed by the requesting party in consultation with the College. For External requests,\n            these costs are the sole responsibility of the requesting party, for internal requests, these costs must be authorized by the responsible cost centre manager.\nAny additional security costs, that are beyond those associated with the actual Use of Space activity request, will be borne by the College.\nThe College reserves the right to deny a Use of Space Request, which would have otherwise been permitted under this policy, where the safety concerns are so significant that it is not possible for the College to be confident that the measures available\n            can protect the safety of the college community or that the cost to provide appropriate security is cost prohibitive.\nThe Manager overseeing the Conference Centre is accountable for adjudicating Use of Space requests within the scope of this policy with respect to the Conference Centre and will put processes in place to enact this policy.\nAll industrial training bookings related to the Fire School will be coordinated by the Fire School staff, keeping the Registrar\u2019s office advised.\nExcept as provided for in section 10 of this policy, the Director, Facilities Management is accountable for adjudicating Use of Space requests within the scope of this policy and will put processes in place to enact this policy.\nProvisions Specific to Internal College Bookings\nInternal College Space bookings include requests for space at the College by staff, faculty, and students. In the case of staff/faculty, such bookings are usually made to support College related business (i.e. meetings, special events, training, seminars).\n            For students, internal bookings would include activities/events that directly support the student\u2019s program or course activities (i.e. class presentations, classrooms/labs booked for study groups/projects, class hallway or common space displays,\n            or minor fund raising for sanctioned program/course objectives).\nInternal bookings, since they serve the business and academic needs/mission of the College, will typically be made free of charge.\nProvisions Specific to External College Bookings\nBookings may be made by individuals, groups/organizations, or other community users requesting College space for meetings, special events, conferences, training sessions, etc. The purpose of these bookings would be for conducting the external group\u2019s\n            own business and would not be related to any College business/activities. External bookings are subject to fees as established by the College.\nUse of Space may not be in direct competition with any College activity.\nA Certificate of Comprehensive Liability Insurance is required for all bookings. Depending on the type of activities and the nature of the event being held, additional insurance coverage may be required, as determined by the College.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 5036, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "653abcfd-6c18-490b-b1de-2ca7d31d4bbf": {"__data__": {"id_": "653abcfd-6c18-490b-b1de-2ca7d31d4bbf", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/nfs/nfs_dsw_phx2_prod/debajyotidasgupta6/chatbot/data/4000-4-3-use-of-college-space.txt", "file_name": "4000-4-3-use-of-college-space.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 7356, "creation_date": "2024-08-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-01"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "8a2678b5-d9a1-4635-996c-d5b178b1ac2b", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/nfs/nfs_dsw_phx2_prod/debajyotidasgupta6/chatbot/data/4000-4-3-use-of-college-space.txt", "file_name": "4000-4-3-use-of-college-space.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 7356, "creation_date": "2024-08-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-01"}, "hash": "0f23b6bcfd78201f706f0f72614eca1f3556331b18319ca387127165e2e9a0ff", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "89c3fde4-aacd-48f3-8db1-bad623ea96d4", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/nfs/nfs_dsw_phx2_prod/debajyotidasgupta6/chatbot/data/4000-4-3-use-of-college-space.txt", "file_name": "4000-4-3-use-of-college-space.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 7356, "creation_date": "2024-08-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-01"}, "hash": "ec281f3cbea90e68590478acaf5b65707447dffe6c7d2704173d528567fcaa70", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "class presentations, classrooms/labs booked for study groups/projects, class hallway or common space displays,\n            or minor fund raising for sanctioned program/course objectives).\nInternal bookings, since they serve the business and academic needs/mission of the College, will typically be made free of charge.\nProvisions Specific to External College Bookings\nBookings may be made by individuals, groups/organizations, or other community users requesting College space for meetings, special events, conferences, training sessions, etc. The purpose of these bookings would be for conducting the external group\u2019s\n            own business and would not be related to any College business/activities.

Information Technology is a valuable\n    College resource that must be shared by the entire College community. Misuse or wasteful use of these resources threatens the realization of the College strategic plan and mission. Information Technology resources must be utilized within the parameters\n    set by the College. Users must abide by all application restrictions, whether or not they can be circumvented by technical means. This policy applies to all users of Information Technology resources, whether affiliated with Lambton College or not,\n    and to all uses of those resources, whether on campus or from remote locations.\nPolicy\nInformation Technology resources may be used only by those individuals - students, employees, retirees, contractors, visitors - who are authorized to do so.\nIn those instances in which user identification (\nUser ID\n) is required, the users must use the identification provided to them by the College, and no other.\nAny\nuser\nof College Information Technology resources must provide current College identification when requested to do so by a College employee.\nUser Responsibility\nUsers are responsible for maintaining the security of their account and password. Accounts and passwords are normally assigned to a single user and are not to be shared with any other individual without authorization by the Director or Manager of\n            the Information Technology Department.\nConcealing or attempting to conceal one's identity when accessing a technical service is prohibited. Masquerading as another individual is also prohibited.\nAny users that suspect their accounts and/or passwords have been compromised, or that their accounts have otherwise been improperly accessed, must immediately report the suspected breach to the Director or Manager of the Information Technology department.\nInformation that comes into possession, to the attention or to the knowledge of an user, by any means (e.g. intent, error, inadvertence), that is private or confidential, or could be reasonably construed or understood as being private or confidential,\n            shall be treated as private or confidential by the user, who shall notify the other person(s) of their possession of the information, and shall not copy, modify, disseminate or otherwise use in any manner the information without the explicit consent\n            of the owner of the information, and shall delete the information at the direction of the owner of the information.

re-authorization is required for individuals requesting a replacement key/card.\nA need for entry alone, when access can be accomplished by other means (such as unlocking doors, request for entry, etc.) shall not convey automatic entitlement to a key/card.\nThe individual to whom keys/cards are issued is ultimately responsible for their proper use, care and safeguarding (e.g. do not store keys/cards in desk drawers or other unsecured areas.)\nOnly one key/card will be issued per individual.\nNo individual or department shall knowingly receive, borrow, loan or transfer individually assigned keys/cards.\nKeys/cards must not be used to grant access to non-authorized individuals.\nLost or stolen keys/cards or keys/cards that are no longer required must be returned to Facilities Management or Security immediately.\nA non-refundable service fee will be applied to the individual, department or company responsible for the lost, missing, stolen or damaged keys/cards; punching holes in the access card will damage and deactivate the assigned credentials.\nKey/card privileges may be revoked if an individual has two or more separate incidents of lost, missing, stolen, damaged or non-returned key/card violations within a one-year period.\nDepartments and contractors will be held financially accountable in situations where re-keying/re-pinning a series of doors is required.\nPublic and community use requiring specific building access must be approved by Facilities Management, the Office of the Registrar & Financial Aid Services and the school.\nStudent admittance to College Facilities will be determined by program requirements and dean approval. Students must have supervision when working in the labs and shops.

Although colleges greatly value civility and all members of colleges share responsibility for maintaining a climate of mutual respect, it is not the role of colleges to shield members\n    of the college community from ideas and opinions that they may find disagreeable or offensive. It is up to individuals and not colleges to make such judgments for themselves and to debate and challenge ideas that they find unacceptable.\nMembers of the college community are free to criticize and contest the views of others; however, they may not obstruct or interfere with the freedom of others to express their views.

The growth, development and operations of the college, year-to-year and day-to-day, are\n    guided by the Strategic Plan.\nThe Board of Governors also establishes an annual budget - consistent with the resources available to the college, Ministry directives and legislation - to provide for the operation of the college and the achievement of its annual plan and, in the longer-term,\n    the Strategic Plan.\nThe\u00a0Strategic Plan will be achieved through the realization of a series of institutional annual plans that incrementally address the Strategic Plan. The annual plans are established and operationalized within the college through the annual planning and\n    budgeting processes, which establish goals, objectives and activities for the year and allocate the required resources.\nThe planning and budgeting processes provide for the achievement of the annual plan within the constraints of the annual budget. Good planning and budgeting will result in an effective and efficient organization - one that achieves the desired outcomes\n    through the efficient use of allocated resources in a manner that reflects its values.\nEffective planning and budgeting are built on processes that gather information, plans and priorities from the ground up, and shape and mould them to achieve the college strategic and annual priorities, and then fully communicate all plans and priorities\n    to all parties. The annual goals and plans then become the responsibility of the relevant managers who, ultimately, are held accountable for their realization and the effective use of the allocated resources.\nThe success of the planning and budgeting processes are dependent upon and flow from:\nthe provision of strategic direction;\nwide and effective gathering of information and employee input;\nthe collation and synthesis of the information; and\nthe assignment of responsibility and successful achievement of goals and assessed budget.\nPolicy\nAnnually, the Board confirms the\u00a0Strategic Plan and establishes goals for the President for the coming year. These goals are, largely, the goals for the College.\nPlanning\nThe President will establish goals for the organization for the next (fiscal) year, consistent with the goals established for the President by the Board and the achievement of the Strategic Plan.\nConsistent with the President\u2019s goals and the college Strategic Plan, the responsible vice-presidents will develop an annual Academic Plan and Student Success Plan, and all vice-presidents will develop performance goals for the approval by the President.\nEach vice-president\u2019s goals, and the Academic Plan and Student Success Plan where relevant, will be distributed to the relevant school deans and department administrators, who will develop school and department goals and then operational plans that\n            will lead to the achievement of the school/department goals and the vice-president goals.\nThe operational plans will reflect the priorities and needs of the schools and departments in their efforts to achieve their goals in support of the vice-president and college goals.\nThe development process for the operational plans must include consultation with all other divisions, schools and departments that potentially may be impacted by the operational plans under development. These consultations may include parallel departments,\n            service departments, student services departments, etc. In most instances, the consultations \u2013 particularly those that involve the need for additional or different resources and services \u2013 will be through formal channels (e.g. use of standard\n            request for service forms.)\nThe operational plan for each school or department will be submitted to the appropriate supervising administrator who will review and consider the submitted plan, consult the involved parties and, if necessary, revise the plan to arrive at the draft\n            operational plan.\nDraft operational plans and school/department goals will be shared and reviewed in a college-wide forum of administrators (academic, student services, administrative services), in order to ensure that all administrators are aware of all goals and\n            plans, particularly those that may have an impact on their own plans and operations.\nDiscussions and modifications of the draft plans may follow the forum.\nUltimately, the draft operational plans will be presented by each administrator to their supervisor for approval.\nIn each division, the sub-division operational plans will separately support and collectively fully address the vice-president\u2019s goals, and the Academic Plan and Student Success Plan if relevant to the sub-division.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 5326, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "697b62d1-bf29-4465-854e-e81b47c8e9e3": {"__data__": {"id_": "697b62d1-bf29-4465-854e-e81b47c8e9e3", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/nfs/nfs_dsw_phx2_prod/debajyotidasgupta6/chatbot/data/4000-5-10-college-planning-budgeting.txt", "file_name": "4000-5-10-college-planning-budgeting.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 10133, "creation_date": "2024-08-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-01"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "410c91ea-e6e6-4a7c-8dc1-c52d472c5b6e", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/nfs/nfs_dsw_phx2_prod/debajyotidasgupta6/chatbot/data/4000-5-10-college-planning-budgeting.txt", "file_name": "4000-5-10-college-planning-budgeting.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 10133, "creation_date": "2024-08-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-01"}, "hash": "02eced3c12be8a48e2256fbc5f7977a63595ea9b236e1de14b8a9e2e0bb08196", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "86b9ff17-e9df-4930-9315-98f1d4565989", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/nfs/nfs_dsw_phx2_prod/debajyotidasgupta6/chatbot/data/4000-5-10-college-planning-budgeting.txt", "file_name": "4000-5-10-college-planning-budgeting.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 10133, "creation_date": "2024-08-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-01"}, "hash": "25b9e46e767ce18c951a5a960246b4ad55138c63547850a9058f496ed5947cda", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "fabf94e0-bb99-4fac-8e92-7a68aec5fe44", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "66bf9dd3f7b45862d3445c8520040ef2d15d5b3d77d9e2c3e418f313fef51317", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "use of standard\n            request for service forms.)\nThe operational plan for each school or department will be submitted to the appropriate supervising administrator who will review and consider the submitted plan, consult the involved parties and, if necessary, revise the plan to arrive at the draft\n            operational plan.\nDraft operational plans and school/department goals will be shared and reviewed in a college-wide forum of administrators (academic, student services, administrative services), in order to ensure that all administrators are aware of all goals and\n            plans, particularly those that may have an impact on their own plans and operations.\nDiscussions and modifications of the draft plans may follow the forum.\nUltimately, the draft operational plans will be presented by each administrator to their supervisor for approval.\nIn each division, the sub-division operational plans will separately support and collectively fully address the vice-president\u2019s goals, and the Academic Plan and Student Success Plan if relevant to the sub-division.

of international travel as a learning experience for its students and the role that international travel may play for employees delivering student learning experiences, and developing and advancing College\n    educational and business interests. The College is also cognizant of the complexities and risks inherent in international travel for both the travellers and the College.\u00a0 This policy addresses risk identification and mitigation, roles and responsibilities,\n    and College expectations for international travel by College students and employees, and associate travellers.\nPolicy\nThis policy applies to all students and employees of Lambton College who travel internationally, i.e. outside of the borders of Canada, on any College-related activities, including, but not limited to, teaching, learning, experiential learning, conferences,\n        meetings, provision of aid, economic or social development, business development and business operations. This policy applies also to individuals who are not students or employees and who travel internationally as part of or in association with\n        College originated, organized or associated activities - hereafter referred to as associates.\nThis policy does not apply to members of the Board of Governors travelling internationally on Board or College business.\nThis policy does not apply to international travel organized by and under the auspices of the Foundation or the Alumni Association. College employees working at the Foundation and Alumni Association are covered by this policy.\nThis policy applies, but with reduced requirements, to travellers undertaking a day trip into Michigan or a drive-through of Michigan.\nIn all cases, the College retains the authority and responsibility for making arrangements and decisions respecting travel, accommodations and insurance requirements. This function will be carried out by authorized College personnel, unless otherwise\n        permitted by an authorized representative of the College.\nAll travellers - students, employees, associates - while traveling internationally on College activities are governed by all College policies. Compliance and behaviour consistent with the policies and College expectations are required of all College\n        travellers. Failure to comply with or behave in a manner consistent with the College policies and expectations may result in disciplinary and/or legal actions by the College.\nAll documents required by this policy or generated as a result of the application of this policy shall be maintained, consistent with the Records Retention policy, by the College administrator approving the travel - typically a Dean. In all cases,\n        the approving administrator shall have all documents on file at the time of the departure of the travellers.\nIt is recognized that not all trips will be conceived or known prior to the launch of the planning cycle. It is within the purview of the approving administrator to waive the first or second step of approval and commence the approval process at the\n        next level when proposals are brought forward later in the planning cycle.\nIn the case of international travel that does not exceed 24 hours and does not go beyond the borders of Ontario and Michigan, the approving administrator may choose to waive certain components, and the associated policy requirements, of the relevant\n        permission and planning forms. The administrator may choose to apply the \u201cDay Trip\u201d version of the applicable form. When the Day Trip forms are used, the application of this policy shall be modified to be consistent with the reduced requirements\n        of the Day Trip forms.\nThe policy statements that follow are grouped by the nature of the traveller(s): Student Group Travel, Student Individual Travel, Employee Individual Travel and Associate Travellers.

For further clarity, this\n            policy applies to College-associated activities and functions including College-related social functions, College work, academic placements, field trips or academic related travel, etc., that occur off campus and involve members of the College\n            community.\nCollege Commitment\nLambton College will take  steps and measures to be supportive, understanding, respectful, responsive and accommodating of all members of the College community who are transgender or gender diverse regardless of transition journey, while at the College.\nThe College will  ensure that its learning, working and living environment is maintained consistent with the Respectful College Community policy, and no member of the community, for any reason - including gender identity,\n            expression - suffers any degradation of the right to equitable treatment and opportunity free of harassment and micro-aggressions.\nEvery member of the College community - including transgender members - has a right to equitable treatment without discrimination in accordance with the provisions of the Ontario Human Rights Code and College policy, and the College will enforce those\n            rights. The College will take appropriate actions and apply appropriate sanctions against individuals who are found to have engaged in harassment or discrimination on the basis of gender identity or gender expression, or who have failed to report\n            such behaviour that is known to them, or of which they reasonably ought to have been aware.\nAll allegations of transphobia (or harassment/discrimination) reported will be investigated in a way that ensures the safety and protection of all those involved and individuals undertaking reprisals or retaliation against an individual for filing a complaint or co-operating in an investigation will be subject to disciplinary action under the relevant College discipline policy.\nMany transgender and transitioning individuals face difficult situations and interactions simultaneously in their personal, professional, family, and financial lives, which can lead to high stress levels, especially in the initial stages of transitioning. The College therefore recognizes that each individual transitioning is dealing with a set of unique circumstances that require an individualized plan with customized support. Individuals seeking such support can contact Human Resources, in the case of an employee, or Counselling, in the case of a student.\nPrivacy and Confidentiality\nAll members of the College community have rights to privacy defined and protected by the law - Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act (FIPPA) - and the\nConfidentiality & Privacy of Information & Records (2000-7-1) policy\n.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 5208, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c84d646d-339f-4f65-938e-5d9db1af6702": {"__data__": {"id_": "c84d646d-339f-4f65-938e-5d9db1af6702", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/nfs/nfs_dsw_phx2_prod/debajyotidasgupta6/chatbot/data/4000-5-12-supporting-transgender-transitioning-college-community-members.txt", "file_name": "4000-5-12-supporting-transgender-transitioning-college-community-members.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 16379, "creation_date": "2024-08-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-01"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "531c5473-1ae3-41f7-932f-280b8e7e1641", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/nfs/nfs_dsw_phx2_prod/debajyotidasgupta6/chatbot/data/4000-5-12-supporting-transgender-transitioning-college-community-members.txt", "file_name": "4000-5-12-supporting-transgender-transitioning-college-community-members.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 16379, "creation_date": "2024-08-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-01"}, "hash": "7451df3eac92ea52a8c90a18bdd9f0d9bb79fe29e94a1100e293307453b3dfcd", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "431c0679-2938-4ef7-af67-59844969ed85", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/nfs/nfs_dsw_phx2_prod/debajyotidasgupta6/chatbot/data/4000-5-12-supporting-transgender-transitioning-college-community-members.txt", "file_name": "4000-5-12-supporting-transgender-transitioning-college-community-members.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 16379, "creation_date": "2024-08-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-01"}, "hash": "bd6d9e89a3e0c39453c339989850e7675b12c94b33dcfd5bb7f0345c33aed912", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "313afd3e-3baf-4f52-90b5-6ff0a0c60e16", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "29a582957c9f4c87cc1e01af6bb596ce06bf4292e38fbd6886120ed3c8d864ba", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Many transgender and transitioning individuals face difficult situations and interactions simultaneously in their personal, professional, family, and financial lives, which can lead to high stress levels, especially in the initial stages of transitioning.

request, the College will provide a copy of this policy in an alternate format.\nThis policy has drawn on and duplicated portions of policies at Harvard University, Algonquin College, Carnegie Mellon University, University of Pennsylvania, Vanier College.\nThe perception that stakeholder groups, as well as the general public, have of Lambton College is influenced by how the College presents itself.\u00a0 All members of the College and the institution as a whole benefit when its name is well used, and suffer\n    when it is ill used.\nThe College regulates the use of its name, the names of its schools and programs, its brand, shield and related insignia and trademarks to ensure that such use is related to the educational, service and research missions of the College and promotes its\n    objectives.\nPolicy\nThe College maintains a legitimate interest in the control and use of its name, brand and insignia.\nThe College has a responsibility to ensure that any implied association with the College is accurate.\nThe College has a responsibility to ensure that the activities with which it is accurately associated maintain standards consistent with its educational purposes.\nThe College has a responsibility to protect its assets by seeking a fair share of the economic value that the use of the Lambton name produces.\nThis policy applies to all College departments and activities, including the College Foundation and Alumni Association, employees and students, institutional partners, and external agencies and identities associated with the College.\nCollege Corporate Identity\nThe senior marketing administrator has delegated authority to oversee the College brand management and corporate identity program, including review, update and management of the Brand Guide.\nAll Lambton College organizational units will maintain a positive and consistent corporate image that promotes Lambton College and reflects its high standards.\nAll applications of the College corporate image must adhere to the guidelines presented in the College Brand Guide and any supporting documents to which it refers.\u00a0 This manual defines use of brand elements such as the College name, logo, icon, photography,\n        colours and graphics, and College parent, sub and endorsed brands across the various media.\nUse of Name & Insignia by College Programs & Individuals\nPrograms, Services & Activities\nCollege names and insignia may be used in connection with any approved College academic program and associated services.\nA Lambton College program, administrative department or officially authorized activity of a program or department must display the name Lambton College in all references and promotion used outside the immediate College community.\nNotwithstanding the above edict to use the Lambton College name for bona fide Lambton activities, organizers of such activities being developed by a Lambton College program or administrative department must ensure that the activity is in fact\n                bona fide (i.e. approved and known as approved within the community.)\nCollege units, faculty, staff and student organizations that wish to use the College name or insignia in connection with any non-academic College program, activity, service or product must obtain the approval of the President of the College before\n        proceeding.\nThe President will review the proposed use and determine, in consultation with appropriate colleagues, whether it is properly related to the College\u2019s missions and whether the benefits of the proposed use outweigh any risks associated with\n                the use.\nThe President may approve the proposed use, with or without conditions, or disapprove the proposed use.\nUse by Individuals & Groups\nLambton College recognizes the interest of individuals and groups who wish to work as citizens through political and community channels for the betterment of society.\u00a0 However, the College as a college is, and must remain, and must be seen as, neutral\n        on political issues.\nEmployees, like any other citizens, have the right to express their

Community Engagement, or approved delegate\nGuidelines for Staff\nThe process of informing the public, through media, about Lambton College is an important part of the Corporate Communications strategy. Raising awareness through this channel will result in continuing to raise the profile of the College\n            and support of Lambton College stakeholders.\nTraditional forms of media along with social media, website, paid advertising, and other promotional materials such as the Viewbook will be utilized as an effective form of advertising, public relations, and brand recognition to highlight news and activities taking place at Lambton College.\nLambton College cannot demand that activities be aired or published - it is an editor's choice to decide what is newsworthy - however, as a College, we can work diligently to bring important highlights and news announcements to the attention of the media\n            on a regular basis.\nThe following guidelines were drawn up to help faculty and staff in situations where they are contacted by a reporter, or when they think an activity or announcement might be of interest to the general public.\nPrime Contact\nThe Senior Director, Community Engagement is the College's primary contact for all news media representatives and should be contacted immediately if faculty or staff are:\ncontacted by a reporter,\nhave information they would like to see publicized.\nIn the event that the Senior Director, Community Engagement can not be reached, the Corporate Communications Coordinator must be notified in any of the above circumstances.\nEstablishing an Effective Relationship with Reporters\nIf contact is made directly by a reporter with questions, the Senior Director or Corporate Communications Coordinator must be contacted immediately, before responding.\nPlease pass on immediately\n- Deadlines are common with media and respect for the deadlines governing a reporter's job should be adhered to, if at all possible.\nHonesty is Lambton's Policy - When dealing with the news media, the College's spokespeople must always be honest. The College is a public institution, and the public has a right to be informed on all College activities. If additional fact seeking is required before a response is possible, it is acceptable to advise the media that the answer to their question(s) is currently unknown, but we will followed up on.\nReferrals\nOften the Director will approve another employee as a \"content expert\" to respond to a media question. In such an instance, it is recommended that the Senior Director, Community Engagement or the Corporate Communications Coordinator help to prepare a response or speaking notes.\nFor questions or concerns regarding this policy, please contact the\nPolicy Sponsor\nby phoning our main line 519-542-7751.\nSearch", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3725, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4dcc9b45-fef6-4b5f-8105-b44065d0c866": {"__data__": {"id_": "4dcc9b45-fef6-4b5f-8105-b44065d0c866", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/nfs/nfs_dsw_phx2_prod/debajyotidasgupta6/chatbot/data/4000-5-15-data-assurance.txt", "file_name": "4000-5-15-data-assurance.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 11614, "creation_date": "2024-08-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-01"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "f4b07cbb-6f23-45ca-bea0-2442aca86374", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/nfs/nfs_dsw_phx2_prod/debajyotidasgupta6/chatbot/data/4000-5-15-data-assurance.txt", "file_name": "4000-5-15-data-assurance.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 11614, "creation_date": "2024-08-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-01"}, "hash": "c3b8860b6a99eecfe5d4de3155cce47c7dbbf537fc7a42d814b7f0481416ed68", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "96d4e078-a591-4b40-938e-2d60980bb235", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "37341b006e4ebb5a728915f6e926b254fec4a44f6a3687bcce8d3682b9f44350", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "All Policies\n1000 Index, Circulation Lists, Amendments\n2000 Academic & Student Affairs\n3000 Personnel Administration\n4000 General Administration\n4000-5-15 Data Assurance\nResponsible Executive\nSenior Vice-President, Strategy & Corporate Services\nPolicy Sponsor\nDirector, Institutional Intelligence & College Registrar\nIssue Date\nOctober 21, 2022\nUpon request, the college will provide a copy of this policy in an alternate format.\nLambton College is a public institution and is committed to ensuring compliance with existing federal and provincial legislation and regulatory responsibility regarding data.\u00a0 Institutional Data is considered a strategic and business critical asset of\n    Lambton College that directly supports the College\u2019s mission and strategic plan.\u00a0 Data is used by the College to inform operational functions as well as to guide policy formation, program development, assessment, and strategic planning.\u00a0 The utility\n    of this data is derived from\u00a0 quality, integrity, security, and access. As an employer, Lambton College collects, uses and discloses data, including personal information, for the purpose of establishing, managing or terminating its employment relationships\n    and managing and auditing its operations. These purposes include preventing and responding to work-related misconduct, breaches of law and other activities that may harm Lambton College\u2019s interest.\u00a0 Data must be safeguarded at all levels against damage,\n    loss and breaches of security and all who use data share this responsibility; regardless of data\u2019s location of access, affiliation, data delivery and data storage.\nThis policy has drawn on and duplicated portions of policies from Humber College.\nPolicy\nData Security\nInstitutional Data must be secured and protected to comply with federal and provincial regulations and to ensure data integrity and availability to the College. Failure to maintain data security may result in the corruption, loss, or exfiltration\n                of critical data. Adequate data assurance mitigates the risk of legal repercussions, reputational damage, unauthorized access to personal information or financial penalties.\nAll users at the College must protect institutional data against misuse, abuse and/or loss.\nData security procedures and guidelines will maintain a consistent and appropriate balance between security and accessibility aligned with the\nUse of Information Technology Resources (4000-4-5)\nand\nConfidentiality & Privacy of Information &\n                Records (2000-7-1)\npolicies.\nData Classification\nData assurance is built on a data classification framework and referenced when handling institutional data based on both criticality and sensitivity of the data.\nData stewards are responsible for implementing assurance controls in accordance with the data\u2019s assigned classification level. Applicable laws or regulations will be taken into consideration when classifying data.\nThe classification system is based on proprietary, strategic, legal, and ethical considerations. Higher levels of cruciality or sensitivity of the data requires stricter assurance controls. The College\u2019s Institutional Data is assigned to one\n                of three (3) categories ranked most critical or sensitive to least.\nData Categories\nRestricted Data\nInstitutional Impact\n- The negative impact on the institution should this data be incorrect, improperly disclosed, improperly accessed, lost, or not available when needed is very high and may include legal, financial,\n                        and reputational consequences. It may also result in harm to individual stakeholders.\nAccess\n- Access to this data occurs only when it is in accordance with legitimate business purposes on a need-to-know basis and when legislation permits. Requests for access should be directed to the relevant Data\n                        Steward.\nDescription\n- Access to restricted data must be controlled from creation to destruction and is granted only to those affiliated with the College who require the data to perform their job.\nIncluded in restricted\n                        data are those which fall under privacy legislation including but not limited to FIPPA (Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act) and PHIPA (Personal Health Information Protection Act.) Also included are data related\n                        to highly sensitive College business including those that may be legal, proprietary, or strategic.\nSensitive Data\nInstitutional Impact\n- The negative impact on the institution should this data be incorrect, improperly disclosed, improperly accessed, lost, or not available when needed is moderate to high.\nAccess\n- Access to this data may be authorized by the Data Steward to groups or individuals based on their job classification or role on a need-to-know basis. Authorized personnel may be given access to systems but\n                        typically to subsections of the data (e.g., as reports or dashboards) to prevent access to more sensitive data that is not required for the individual\u2019s business purposes.\nDescription\n- Sensitive data is intended to be protected from broad consumption on account of business concerns, such as those related to competition and institutional strategic decision-making. Examples may include\n                        data related to budgeting, financial reports, facilities, and human resources information.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 5405, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "96d4e078-a591-4b40-938e-2d60980bb235": {"__data__": {"id_": "96d4e078-a591-4b40-938e-2d60980bb235", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/nfs/nfs_dsw_phx2_prod/debajyotidasgupta6/chatbot/data/4000-5-15-data-assurance.txt", "file_name": "4000-5-15-data-assurance.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 11614, "creation_date": "2024-08-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-01"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "f4b07cbb-6f23-45ca-bea0-2442aca86374", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/nfs/nfs_dsw_phx2_prod/debajyotidasgupta6/chatbot/data/4000-5-15-data-assurance.txt", "file_name": "4000-5-15-data-assurance.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 11614, "creation_date": "2024-08-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-01"}, "hash": "c3b8860b6a99eecfe5d4de3155cce47c7dbbf537fc7a42d814b7f0481416ed68", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "4dcc9b45-fef6-4b5f-8105-b44065d0c866", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/nfs/nfs_dsw_phx2_prod/debajyotidasgupta6/chatbot/data/4000-5-15-data-assurance.txt", "file_name": "4000-5-15-data-assurance.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 11614, "creation_date": "2024-08-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-01"}, "hash": "39ab52888fb011e7888e90a6e620d81eba40e1250c2534bec3c07325b508afe7", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "071d7e6c-1353-43c8-9066-fd928274040a", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "f325ecbd588e52e3e00a8d357876b278d98b5a22bd7d6f06c0e0f26bdf8bf9eb", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Also included are data related\n                        to highly sensitive College business including those that may be legal, proprietary, or strategic.\nSensitive Data\nInstitutional Impact\n- The negative impact on the institution should this data be incorrect, improperly disclosed, improperly accessed, lost, or not available when needed is moderate to high.\nAccess\n- Access to this data may be authorized by the Data Steward to groups or individuals based on their job classification or role on a need-to-know basis.

It is important that these constituencies have confidence that College employees conduct themselves with integrity and in a manner that does not give\n    rise to conflicts of interests.\u00a0 This policy establishes rules of ethical conduct applicable to College employees and certain former Designated College employees, and is intended to assist College employees to avoid placing themselves in a position\n    of a conflict of interests.\nThe fundamental tenet of this policy is that members of the College community should, of their own volition, disclose situations that give rise to a real, potential, or perceived conflict of interest.\nThe mere existence of a conflict or a potential conflict of interest does not necessarily imply that the activity in question should cease; there may be options to limit or mitigate the detrimental effects.\nConflicts cover a broad spectrum.\u00a0 There are situations sufficiently complex that opinions or judgments may differ as to whether or not a conflict exists. Accordingly, employees are encouraged to proactively engage in conversation with the College concerning\n    any possible conflict of interests.\nPolicy\nA conflict of interest arises in any situation where an individual's private interests, including the interests of family members, friends and associates, or others with whom the employee relationship may be incompatible or in conflict with the individual's\n            responsibilities as a College employee.\nA conflict of interest or a potential conflict of interest exists when a member of the College is in, or may be in, a position to use research, knowledge, authority or influence for personal or family gain or to benefit others with a personal\n                    connection, to the detriment of the institution, its students or its research partners or clients.\n[1]\nA conflict of interest arises when an individual's private, personal or commercial interests may be incompatible, or in conflict, with the individual's responsibilities as an employee of the College or when the individual has the opportunity\n                    to advance or protect personal interests, or the interests of others with whom the employee has a personal connection, in a way that is, or potentially is, detrimental to the interests of the College or harmful to the integrity of mission\n                    of the College.\nThis conflict of interest policy applies to all Lambton College employees and volunteers. In this policy, all uses of the word employee(s) should be understood to include volunteers.\nA Lambton College employee who does not comply with the provisions of this policy may be disciplined as appropriate, up to and including dismissal. Civil action may be taken against an individual, outside entity or organization where failure to comply\n            with the provisions of this policy results in loss of damage to Lambton College or its reputation.\nExpectations of Employees\nCollege employees must act honestly and uphold the highest ethical standards in the conduct of College business and activities and in performing their roles as employees.\nCollege employees are obligated to perform their duties and conduct themselves in a manner that will bear the closest public scrutiny. College employees cannot fulfill this obligation simply by acting within the law; they must also be perceived to\n            be acting ethically and within the law.\nCollege employees shall not have private interests, other than those permitted pursuant to this policy, or that are permitted under applicable laws or statutes, that would be affected by College actions which the employee(s) participate or conversely,\n            that would affect the behaviours and decisions of the individual(s) as a College employee.\nLambton College employees must arrange their private interests to prevent real or perceived conflicts of interest. If a conflict does arise between the private interest of an employee and the College duties and responsibilities of that employee, the\n            conflict shall be resolved in favour of the College interest.\nDuty to Disclose\nThe fundamental tenent of this policy is that members of the College community should, of their own volition, disclose situations that give rise to a real, potential or perceived conflict of interest.\nA College employee must disclose any existing or potential conflict of interest (or perceived conflict of interest) situations to the employee's supervisor to resolve.\nEmployees are strongly encouraged to engage in conversation with the College proactively concerning any possible conflict of interests.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 5193, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "cba79e34-7660-483d-9e6c-05fa5cb3a5bf": {"__data__": {"id_": "cba79e34-7660-483d-9e6c-05fa5cb3a5bf", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/nfs/nfs_dsw_phx2_prod/debajyotidasgupta6/chatbot/data/4000-5-4-conflict-of-interest.txt", "file_name": "4000-5-4-conflict-of-interest.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 13513, "creation_date": "2024-08-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-01"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "b526efd6-bf04-45b2-8ce5-76b8434ae561", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/nfs/nfs_dsw_phx2_prod/debajyotidasgupta6/chatbot/data/4000-5-4-conflict-of-interest.txt", "file_name": "4000-5-4-conflict-of-interest.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 13513, "creation_date": "2024-08-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-01"}, "hash": "50a2e2654c165789c151e482c5e88feb8714500f3fbcc2aa862938da3a6b2c6e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "9534b8f0-0c3a-4b40-aa1a-59073e7de210", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/nfs/nfs_dsw_phx2_prod/debajyotidasgupta6/chatbot/data/4000-5-4-conflict-of-interest.txt", "file_name": "4000-5-4-conflict-of-interest.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 13513, "creation_date": "2024-08-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-01"}, "hash": "9c509f44ce9e8ac024c8aa766d4b83e6e34d627b4450f5c715992074a7b824a2", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "df309cff-be2d-4623-9da4-58feaf859e6f", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "71bbdc55b4e032a0f2734da0fe88d4df3899459d6e4834ae352a5b41f702c956", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Lambton College employees must arrange their private interests to prevent real or perceived conflicts of interest.

To qualify for fair dealing, two tests must be passed.\nFirst, the \"dealing\" must be for a purpose stated in the\nCopyright Act\n: research, private study, criticism, review, news reporting, education, satire, and parody. Educational use of a copyright-protected work passes the first test.\nThe second test is that the dealing must be \"fair.\" In landmark decisions in 2004 and in 2012, the Supreme Court of Canada provided guidance as to what this test means in schools and post-secondary educational institutions.\nThis Fair Dealing Policy applies fair dealing in non-profit K-12 schools and post-secondary educational institutions and provides reasonable safeguards for the owners of copyright-protected works in accordance with the\nCopyright Act\nand the Supreme\n    Court decisions.\nGuidelines from ACCC Fair Dealing Policy\nTeachers, instructors, professors and staff members in non-profit educational institutions may communicate and reproduce, in paper or electronic form, short excerpts from a copyright-protected work for the purposes of research, private study, criticism,\n        review, news reporting, education, satire and parody.\nCopying or communicating short excerpts from a copyright-protected work under this Fair Dealing Policy for the purpose of news reporting, criticism or review should mention the source and, if given in the source, the name of the author or creator\n        of the work.\nA single copy of a short excerpt from a copyright-protected work may be provided or communicated to each student enrolled in a class or course:\nas a class handout\nas a posting to a learning or course management system that is password protected or otherwise restricted to students of a school or post-secondary educational institution\nas part of a course pack\nA short excerpt means:\nup to 10% of a copyright-protected work (including a literary work, musical score, sound recording, and an audiovisual work)\none chapter from a book\na single article from a periodical\nan entire artistic work (including a painting, print, photograph, diagram, drawing, map, chart, and plan) from a copyright-protected work containing other artistic works\nan entire newspaper article or page\nan entire single poem or musical score from a copyright-protected work containing other poems or musical scores\nan entire entry from an encyclopedia, annotated bibliography, dictionary or similar reference work\nCopying or communicating multiple short excerpts from the same copyright-protected work, with the intention of copying or communicating substantially the entire work, is prohibited.\nCopying or communicating that exceeds the limits in this Fair Dealing Policy should be referred to the Director, Teaching & Learning Commons or his/her designate for evaluation. An evaluation of whether the proposed copying or communication is permitted\n        under fair dealing will be made based on all relevant circumstances.\nNo fees will be charged by the College for communicating or copying a short excerpt from a copyright-protected work other than to cover the costs of the institution, including overhead costs.\nFor questions or concerns regarding this policy,

No department may establish its own collections of resources. Centralization avoids duplication of resources and unnecessary expense,and provides bibliographic\n            control of resources. It also makes it possible to extend the use of all resources to the entire College community.\nThe Lambton College Archives, as part of the TLC, will acquire archival material that serves the long\u2010term administrative and legal needs of the College, and private archives that support the research needs of the College community.\nThe Director, in consultation with the employees of the TLC, shall establish, maintain, and amend departmental policies and regulations pertaining to Collection Development and Circulation as required.\nIn any instance where the\u00a0TLC policies, rules or regulations conflict with the policies, rules or regulations established by the College, the College policies, rules or regulations shall take precedence.\nFor questions or concerns regarding this policy, please contact the\nPolicy Sponsor\nby phoning our main line 519-542-7751.\nSearch", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2968, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "206b5d27-266f-4c54-84f2-c226d4fedac8": {"__data__": {"id_": "206b5d27-266f-4c54-84f2-c226d4fedac8", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/nfs/nfs_dsw_phx2_prod/debajyotidasgupta6/chatbot/data/4000-7-1-accessibility-accommodation-for-all-persons.txt", "file_name": "4000-7-1-accessibility-accommodation-for-all-persons.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 12298, "creation_date": "2024-08-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-01"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "9f2c62d4-f287-4aea-9f77-3199b2efdbf4", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/nfs/nfs_dsw_phx2_prod/debajyotidasgupta6/chatbot/data/4000-7-1-accessibility-accommodation-for-all-persons.txt", "file_name": "4000-7-1-accessibility-accommodation-for-all-persons.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 12298, "creation_date": "2024-08-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-01"}, "hash": "57aea6d3b2a65498ed5df5eed05683673f4d388304ad748b33a8fca3cb88138c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "1da9a7d0-deae-4a70-bb68-2e2f34c42978", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "02a85c6f551905f1396e9bbd43eb5cd871e32c560240d3fab4985134b7e63e31", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "All Policies\n1000 Index, Circulation Lists, Amendments\n2000 Academic & Student Affairs\n3000 Personnel Administration\n4000 General Administration\n4000-7-1 Accessibility & Accommodation for all Persons\nResponsible Executive\nSenior Vice-President, Strategy & Corporate Services\nPolicy Sponsor\nDirector, Facilities Management\nIssue Date\nDecember 16, 2009\nSupersedes Date\nMay 9, 2016\nReplaces\nFormer policy titled Customer Service\nLast Review\nAugust 30, 2023\nLast Revision\nAugust 30, 2023\nUpon request, the college will provide a copy of this policy in an alternate format.\nLambton College is committed to providing students, clients, employees and members of the public with a learning and working environment that respects the rights of all as enshrined in the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms and the Ontario Human\n    Rights Code.
