Appendix 3
Broader Public Sector (BPS) Procurement Directive
Issued by Management Board of Cabinet, Province of Ontario
The purpose of the BPS Directive is:
To ensure that publicly funded goods and services, including construction, consulting services, and information technology are acquired by BPS organizations through a process that is open, fair, and transparent;
To outline responsibilities of BPS organizations throughout each stage of the procurement process; and
To ensure that procurement processes are managed consistently throughout the BPS.
This Directive is based on the five key principles that allow Organizations to achieve value for money while following a procurement process that is fair and transparent to all stakeholders:
Accountability
Organizations must be accountable for the results of their procurement decisions and the appropriateness of the processes.
Transparency
Organizations must be transparent to all stakeholders. Wherever possible, stakeholders must have equal access to information on procurement opportunities, processes and results.
Value for Money
Organizations must maximize the value they receive from the use of public funds. A value-for-money approach aims to deliver goods and services at the optimum total lifecycle cost.
Quality Service Delivery
Front-line services provided by Organizations, such as teaching and patient care, must receive the right product, at the right time, in the right place.
Process Standardization
Standardized processes remove inefficiencies and create a level playing field.
BPS Procurement Directive - Supply Chain Code of Ethics
Goal
An ethical, professional and accountable supply chain
Personal Integrity and Professionalism
All broader public sector (BPS) supply chain participants must act, and be seen to act, with integrity and professionalism. Honesty, care and due diligence must be integral to all supply chain activities within and between BPS organizations, suppliers
        and other stakeholders. Respect must be demonstrated for each other and for the environment. Confidential information must be safeguarded. Participants must not accept gifts and favours, provide preferential treatment, publicly endorse suppliers
        or products or engage in any other activity that would create, or appear to create, a conflict of interest.
Accountability & Transparency
Supply chain activities must be open and accountable. In particular, tendering, contracting and purchasing activities must be fair, transparent and conducted with a view to obtaining the best value for public money. All participants must ensure that
        scarce public sector resources are used in a responsible, efficient and effective manner.
Compliance & Continuous Improvement
All BPS supply chain participants must comply with this Code of Ethics and the laws of Canada and Ontario. Participants should continuously work to improve supply chain policies and procedures, to improve supply chain knowledge and skill levels, and
        to share leading practices.
