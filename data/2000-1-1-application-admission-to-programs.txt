For admission to a degree program, applicants must normally meet the following minimum requirements:
An Ontario Secondary School Diploma (O.S.S.D.) or equivalent (e.g. for credentials earned in Quebec, applicants should have a Secondary V Diploma and at least one year (minimum 12 academic courses) in a CEGEP academic diploma program, with subjects at stated levels to the degree program;
Six university or university/college courses are the Grade 12 level;
A minimum average across six Grade 12 courses of 65%;

An objective and transparent tool will be employed to assess applicants' non-academic attributes.
Mature student applicants must demonstrate academic abilities equivalent to those of Ontario high school graduates, verified by successful completion of courses at the post-secondary level or an entrance examination(s).
Some programs may accept students for advanced placement through a bridging program or via a program-to-program agreement. The program will establish and publish the admission requirements associated with the bridging or program-to-program agreement.
Re-Admission to the College or a Program
Abandonment of Program
A student who has failed to remain continuously registered through the typical sequence of semesters for a program will be deemed to have abandoned the program and must apply for re-admission to the program. Application must be made through the
ontariocolleges.ca
.
Re-admission to the program will be subject to the availability of space in the program.
Academic Dismissal
A student who has been dismissed from the College because of unsatisfactory academic performance may apply for re-admission after the designated period of dismissal which is normally 12 months. The Registrar, in consultation with the appropriate Dean, may waive the dismissal period.
A dismissed student must apply to the Registrar for re-admission. The application must provide a rationale and arguments for re-admission. The Registrar will determine the eligibility or non-eligibility of the student for re-admission to the College.
If approved for re-admission to the College, the student must apply through
ontariocolleges.ca
for re-admission to the program. The Registrar, in consultation with the appropriate Dean, will determine re-admission of the student to the program.
Subsequent admission or re-admission to a program will be subject to the applicant meeting program admission requirements and the availability of space in the program.
Expulsion from College
A student who has been expelled from the College for disciplinary reasons must apply in writing to the Registrar seeking permission for re-admission to the College. The application must provide a rationale and arguments for the re-admission of the student. The Registrar will determine the eligibility or non-eligibility of the student for re-admission to the College and a program. Re-admission will not be considered for a minimum of five years from the date of expulsion, as per the
Student Rights & Responsibilities & Discipline (2000-5-1)Â policy

Subsequent admission or re-admission to a program will be subject to the applicant meeting program admission requirements and the availability of space in the program.
Criminal Record and Vulnerable Persons Checks
Some College programs have a clinical, field, co-op, or work-placement component within the curriculum. Students in such programs may be required by the host agency or employer to provide a current criminal record check from a police service and/or a vulnerable person check before the student may start the placement. Individuals who have a criminal record and have not been pardoned or have an imperfect vulnerable person check report may not be accepted by any employer or host agency and so may not be able to participate in a clinical, field, co-op, or work placement. A criminal record without a pardon or an imperfect vulnerable person check report will not prevent admission to a program, but may seriously impair the student's opportunity or ability to meet program graduation requirements with respect to clinical, field, co-op, or work placement, or find employment in the vocation after graduation.
Placement Requirements
Some College programs have a clinical, field, co-op or work-placement component that requires the employment or acceptance of the student by an agency or employer. The agency or employer may have requirements such as a criminal record check, a vulnerable persons check or current immunization. It is the students' responsibilities to ensure that they are eligible and willing to meet the requirements in order to be able to participate in all components of a program for which they apply or register.
The College assumes no responsibility for accommodating a student, and will not refund tuition to a student, who is unable or unwilling to attain a placement, or subsequent employment because of an inability or unwillingness to satisfy criminal record check, vulnerable persons check, immunization or other such requirements of agencies and employers, or relocate or otherwise be available and eligible for employment.
The cost associated with a criminal record check, a Vulnerable Person Check, immunization, and/or other such placement expenses are the responsibility of the student.
Admission Selection and Ranking of Applicants
Selection Criteria
When there are more qualified applicants than spaces available in a program (e.g. a highly competitive program), the College will use formal selection techniques to determine successful applicants
The formal selection techniques will be used to rank the applicants who have met the minimum entrance requirements and applicants will be admitted to the program on the basis of the rankings until all available spaces have been filled.
When there are more applicants who meet the minimum entrance requirements for a program than there are spaces available in the program, an applicant who meets the minimum entrance requirements ultimately may not be accepted into the program.
The selection techniques and process will be fairly applied, transparent, publishing on the College website and be consistent with the Ontario Human Rights Code and Ministry requirements and binding policy.
The criteria and selection techniques may vary from program to program.
Priority of Admissions
Applicants whose applications were received by the application equal-consideration deadline will be considered first.
Applications received after the deadline will be considered only if spaces remain open after admission has been offered to all qualified applicants whose applications were received by the deadline.
If admission is offered to late applicants, it will be offered to qualified applicants on a first-come, first-offered basis, if and while spaces remain in the program.
If there are more qualified applicants than spaces in a program, applicants will be admitted in the following order, as required by the Ministry:
Permanent residents of Ontario
Permanent residents of another Canadian province
Citizens of other countries
If there remain more applicants than available spaces for any of the above categories, then the selection process will be applied to provide a ranking of the qualified applicants within each category. Admission will be offered based on the ranking within each category and will proceed through the categories as listed.
The College reserves the right, as part of the College Indigenous Academic & Student Success Plan, to designate spaces in highly competitive programs to Indigenous (status, non-status, MÃ©tis & Inuit) students who have satisfied the minimum program admission requirements.
Unsuccessful Applicants
Consistent with the Ministry guidelines, Lambton College provides applicants who feel that they have been inappropriately or unfairly denied admission a means to appeal the admission decision through written application to the Office of the Dean of the program. The required appeal form may be obtained from, and when completed, returned to the Office of the Registrar & Financial Aid Services for forwarding to the Office of the Dean. The decision will be appealed under the
Appeal of an Academic Decision (2000-1-13) policy
.
The program admission requirements and selection criteria may not be appealed.
Appeal of admission decisions that are received less than five working days from before the first day of classes will only be considered for the next intake of the program.
