Policy
The purpose of this plan is to assist the College in managing the impact of a health crisis (such as COVID-19 Pandemic) while: maintaining our mission of promoting student and community success; and keeping academic excellence, student & community
            success, and technological & service excellence as a focus. The goal is based on three main strategies:
Reducing spread of the virus within Lambton College facilities and the community;
Sustaining educational and activity functions; and
Sustaining facility operational functions.
In order for the goal to be met, it will be necessary to provide resources needed for protecting individuals and identify essential services within the College that must continue to be provided in a health crisis. Through effective leadership, organization,
            and participation by all members of the College community the plan will assist in continued College operation under difficult circumstances.
Infection Control
All members of the College community will be encouraged to follow good hygiene practices to reduce or slow the spread of infections and viruses.
Leadership
In the event of an epidemic or pandemic, the College will form a Pandemic Steering Committee who will oversee the college-wide plan and issue all directives.
