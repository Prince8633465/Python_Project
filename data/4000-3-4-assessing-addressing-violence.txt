Policy
Lambton College will not tolerate any form of workplace violence or any situation that places a member of the College community in a position that may jeopardize their personal safety on College property or during any College activity.
All individuals are responsible for maintaining, promoting, and contributing to a safe work and educational environment.
The College will assess, and reassess as often as is necessary, the risks of workplace violence which may arise from the nature of the workplace, the type of work or the conditions of work.
The College will establish measures and procedures to control the risks identified in the assessment.
The College will advise the Joint Occupational Health and Safety Committee, or Health and Safety Representative, if any, of the results of the assessment, and provide a copy if the assessment is in writing.
The College will ensure measures and procedures for summoning immediate assistance when an act of workplace violence occurs or is likely to occur.
The College will ensure measures and procedures for reporting incidents of workplace violence.
The College will investigate and deal with incidents or complaints of workplace violence quickly, fairly, and effectively.
If the College becomes aware, or ought reasonably to be aware, that domestic violence that would likely expose an employee to physical injury may occur in the workplace, the College will take every precaution reasonable in the circumstances for the
        protection of the worker.
The College will provide information and instruction regarding workplace violence.
Confidentiality
Lambton College has a duty to provide personal information related to a risk of workplace violence from a person with a history of violent behaviour if:
The worker can be expected to encounter that person in the course of their work, and
The risk of workplace violence is likely to expose the worker to physical injury
The College shall not disclose more personal information in the circumstances than is reasonably necessary to protect the worker from physical injury.
Sanctions
Documented and substantiated situations of workplace violence may result in disciplinary action according to the Employee Discipline Policy, Students Rights and Responsibilities and Discipline Policy, other appropriate College policies, or through
        police action.
Where a person believes that their personal safety may be at risk, the College reserves the right to issue a Notice of Trespass, during and at the conclusion of any investigation and/or resolution, to an individual(s) alleged to have committed an
        act of workplace violence.
All employees and students of the College community are required to participate in College proceedings related to this policy as part of their contractual obligation with the College and are encouraged to participate in any criminal investigation/proceeding
        conducted by the police and courts. However, it does not preclude the right of the College or an individual to seek other legal options.
It is understood, that the College and all members of the College community may continue to exercise their pre-existing legal rights without recourse to this policy.
